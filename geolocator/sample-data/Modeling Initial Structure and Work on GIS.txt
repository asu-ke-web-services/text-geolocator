"<p>Develop a simulation model based on the Geographic Information System that predicts both ecological consequences and dynamic change in size, arrangement, and abundance of different patch (land cover) types across the CAP LTER study area.</p>

"<p>We are developing a series of computer simulation models that can be used as experimentation tools to enhance our understanding of how urban development interacts with natural environment. The models will be built at different spatial scales. At the local scale, patch models relate patch characteristics (e.g., size, shape, land cover, disturbance regime) to ecological and socioeconomic variables of interest. The patches may be vegetation remnants, shopping centers, residential areas, and golf courses. These models will provide information that is necessary not only for understanding fine-scale interactions between urbanization and ecology, but also for constructing and parameterizing coarser-scale models. At the landscape level, we will build models for distinctive landscapes: natural vegetation dominated areas, suburban areas, and highly urbanized areas. These landscape models explicitly consider spatial heterogeneity and interactions among patches of different patches. At the regional (CAP) scale, we will build a hierarchically structured, patch dynamic, spatially explicit simulation model, which incorporates the interactions between landscape pattern and ecological and socioeconomic processes at different scales. Urban growth and the interactions among different kinds of landscapes are explicitly dealt with in particular. For example, topography, transportation network (roads), land cover/use maps, and spatial distributions of measures of biodiversity and other ecosystem properties are used as input/output layers.</p>
