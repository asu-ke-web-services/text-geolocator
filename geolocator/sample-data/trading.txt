In the United States of America there are many places to visit.   The capital city of the entire U.S.A. is Washington D.C. The common language spoken there is English, but there are many people with different ethnic backgrounds who speak different languages that call the United States there home. The population according to the U.S. Bureau of Census as of October 31st, 2003, is 292, 475,565. The America way of life and their type of government is a democracy. The United States of America is known as the Land of the Free¬ù. The Total area of the U.S. is 9,629,091 squared kilometers. Its climate is, mostly temperate, but tropical in Hawaii and Florida, arctic in Alaska, semiarid in the great plains west of the Mississippi River, and arid in the Great Basin of the southwest; low winter temperatures in the northwest are ameliorated occasionally in January and February by warm Chinook winds from the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains. They have four different time zones: Pacific time zone, Mountain time zone, Central time zone and the Eastern time zone.
The Government and International Business:
Americans government is a constitutionally based federal republic. They have a strong democratic tradition as well. They are a very patriotic nation. The United States welcome many internationally owned businesses and they are a part of many of the worlds trading organizations.
Every year the United States exports approximately 687 billion dollars worth of products. There main exports are: capital goods, automobiles, industrial supplies and raw materials, consumer goods and agricultural products. There major trading countries are amazing.
The United States of American imports approximately 1.165 trillion dollars of products every year. The goods they import the most are: crude oil and refined petroleum products, machinery, automobiles, consumer goods, industrial raw materials, food and beverages. 
There are many products that the United States would beg for and specialize in many different types of services that could potentially expand the United States economy. One thing that almost every city is aware of is snow. Many American people have not even seen snow in there life time, that is why snowplow removal could feasibly be a remarkably successful business venture. Though there are many additional cost factors. The lack of snow in certain areas can drastically reduce income and could possibly cause bankruptcy forcing one to close their business. If one were to take this business somewhere more south, the outcome could be devastating. Taking this type of business to a location where the climate is rather arid or tropical would not be recommended, statistics have shown that chance for snow are next to none. Also seeing a person driving a snowplow in above warm conditions could be very conspicuous and indubitably preposterous.
A product that could be an excellent export to the United States would be chickens. Everyone loves chickens.
Wiggins, Mississippi has chickens.  People love visiting Wiggins, Mississippi.  Sometimes Montgomery, Alabama has chickens too.  The thing I like most about chickens.  Phoenix, Arizona has also abundant amount of chickens.  Sometimes these chickens lay eggs which makes more chicken.   Norfolk, Nebraska is very interesting.  They have alligators.  Jacksonville, Florida also has alligators. 
We love to export from Munich, Germany.  They have chocolate.  We also love London from the United Kingdom.
