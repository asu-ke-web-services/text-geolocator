"3","Urban Fringe Morphology","<p>Identify the current boundary of the greater Phoenix metropolitan urban area and study which factors are responsible for the spatial pattern of new development on the urban fringes.</p>
<p>Rapidly growing cities like Phoenix expand quickly into previously undeveloped territory. This project will track the spatial distribution of the city's urban fringe through the development of its urban infrastructure, the water and sewer lines. The goal is to identify the extent, spatial discontinuities, and development sequence of the changing urban fringe boundary, to identify the variables that best explain the geography of fringe infrastructure development, and finally to link these findings to the model of stages of fringe morphology.</p>
","
<p>The urban fringe morphology project has the following three elements:</p>

<p>1. Calculate land consumption rates and land absorption coefficients by Valley community. Jeff James, a graduate research assistant, is conducting an analysis of population and employment densities using Maricopa Association of Government data. He will produce 1990-1995 land consumption rates and land absorption coefficients for the 25 local municipalities in the Valley. We also are exploring the feasibility of including 1980 Census data in this analysis. Kim Knowles-Yanez, the CAP LTER post-doc, will conduct a qualitative inventory of community planning and development policies for the 25 municipalities. Our goal is to determine whether differing community land use policies resulted in varying intensities of land development at the fringe. In other words, were communities with stricter development controls more successful in stimulating higher density development than communities with weaker controls</p>

<p>2. Identify the indirect visible urban fringe. Beyond the built-up area is a zone that is on the brink of urban development. It is affected by urbanization, but does not yet meet the threshold density for inclusion in the urbanized area. We seek to monitor the changes in this landscape as urbanization unfolds through two methods. First, we are investigating how feasible it is to study this area through land cover changes, watching the turnover from agriculture and open space to built-up area. We also plan to monitor more localized landscape change through fieldwork. The literature suggests a number of landscape features that mark incipient urbanization, including the presence of dog kennels and boarding stables, horse trails, cell-phone towers, and real estate signs. The product of this exercise will be a narrative of pre-urban fringe activity. What activities are precursors of fringe development in Phoenix?</p>

<p>3. Identify the indirect invisible urban fringe. Also in areas at the cusp of development, we want to monitor land use change that is invisible to the naked eye. Soon-to-be-developed areas are characterized by a flurry of real estate transactions and by a shift in ownership from private individuals to corporations. We have been working with Dr. Tim Hogan to use Center for Business Research files of metropolitan real estate transactions categorized by location and types of owner. Predictably, these data are not organized for our purposes and will require considerable effort to make them usable to us. Our goal here is to examine land tenure change as the fringe unfolds. We plan to conduct this analysis for the same four areas where we will do field work to identify the visible markers of urban development.</p>

"4","Modeling: Initial Structure and Work on GIS","<p>Develop a simulation model based on the Geographic Information System that predicts both ecological consequences and dynamic change in size, arrangement, and abundance of different patch (land cover) types across the CAP LTER study area.</p>
",NULL,"<p>We are developing a series of computer simulation models that can be used as experimentation tools to enhance our understanding of how urban development interacts with natural environment. The models will be built at different spatial scales. At the local scale, patch models relate patch characteristics (e.g., size, shape, land cover, disturbance regime) to ecological and socioeconomic variables of interest. The patches may be vegetation remnants, shopping centers, residential areas, and golf courses. These models will provide information that is necessary not only for understanding fine-scale interactions between urbanization and ecology, but also for constructing and parameterizing coarser-scale models. At the landscape level, we will build models for distinctive landscapes: natural vegetation dominated areas, suburban areas, and highly urbanized areas. These landscape models explicitly consider spatial heterogeneity and interactions among patches of different patches. At the regional (CAP) scale, we will build a hierarchically structured, patch dynamic, spatially explicit simulation model, which incorporates the interactions between landscape pattern and ecological and socioeconomic processes at different scales. Urban growth and the interactions among different kinds of landscapes are explicitly dealt with in particular. For example, topography, transportation network (roads), land cover/use maps, and spatial distributions of measures of biodiversity and other ecosystem properties are used as input/output layers.</p>

"5","Century-scale Channel Change","<p>Study how the geomorphology of the Salt River channel has changed over the last 100 years and how factors such as the damming of the Salt and Verde Rivers and gravel mining operations have contributed to these changes.</p>

",NULL,"<p>For more than 1,000 years there has been a city on the banks of the Salt and Gila Rivers in the vicinity of what is now Phoenix. The course of natural processes as embodied by the river have interacted with the course of human events as evidenced by the city, each exerting influence on the other. The myriad of tangled connections between the natural and social systems has inevitably altered each of them, so that understanding of one without understanding of the other is incomplete. Within the last 100 years, intensive technological development of the river resources, its space, water, materials, and biotic complements, has radically altered the natural processes and forms of the river. At the same time, the river has influenced development of the city, sometimes as a resource such as recreational space, and sometimes as a hazard such as flooding. This constantly changing fluvial system, integrating natural and artificial influences, is the foundation for the primary riparian ecosystems of the region.</p>

<p>The research questions of this project are: (1) What has been the nature of change in the geomorphic/riparian system, and how have human and natural factors controlled the distribution and intensity of the change over the past century? (2) Why does the river have its present geomorphic/riparian configuration, and how stable is that arrangement from geomorphic, hydrologic, and geographic perspectives? and (3) How does the river respond to ongoing changes in the spatial arrangement of human activities and attending technological impacts? </p>

<p>This project promises improved understanding of the dynamics of dryland rivers, especially how and why they change under the influence of urban development. The research also promises to provide an integrating factor in the CAP LTER effort, because the river integrates the influences of hydrologic, geomorphic, biotic, and human technological systems. The research will provide a repeatable quantitative approach to assessing the changes in the river and as it continues its millennium-long connection between natural and social systems.</p>
"
"6","Quaternary Geomorphology Study and Data Synthesis","<p>

  Compile a digital geological map for the CAP LTER study area and examine what geological changes have taken place in the landscape, with particular attention focused on alluvial and fluvial processes over the Quaternary period.

</p>

",NULL,"<p>The development of the landscape in the CAP LTER region over the last million years has determined the distribution of materials at the surface and in the shallow subsurface and has controlled the topographic form of the region. These effects define the spatial and temporal context for the ecological relationships that we study. The recent geologic history of the CAP LTER region has been dominated by the activity of the rivers that flow through it. The Gila River and its important tributaries -- the Salt, Hassayampa, and Agua Fria Rivers -- has existed as a major tributary of the Colorado River for the past 8-9 million years. Alluvial deposits filled the Basin floor for much of the early and middle Pleistocene. This was followed in the late Pleistocene and early Holocene by a period of downcutting during which the drainages removed some earlier alluvial material and formed a series of inset terraces. This alternation of aggradation and entrenchment was apparently driven by climatically correlated changes in surface transport rates and sediment supply.</p>

<p>We are gaining an understanding of the development of the landscape by applying traditional and new geological mapping methods to document the distribution of materials and the relative ages of geologic events. That has included generating detailed maps in the area of the White Tank Mountains west of Phoenix (Wood and Robinson) and Union Hills and northern Paradise Valley (Holloway), and will include investigating the shallow subsurface in the area of the White Tanks using gravimetric methods to attempt a mass balance for the Quaternary sediment production, erosion, transport, and sedimentation in the region. One of the outstanding questions is the timing of landscape development. We have made good progress in our efforts to apply the tool of cosmogenic dating to establish numerical ages for the incision and aggradation events.</p>

<p>Cosmogenic dating is possible because measurable isotopes form in surface matter as a result of cosmic ray bombardment. These isotopes form by a chain of subatomic to nuclear interactions (mostly by the collision of thermal neutrons with parent isotopes) initiated by the penetration of the atmosphere by cosmic rays. Rates of accumulation of these isotopes have been determined experimentally. Thus, the exposure age can be calculated from the amount of isotope measured in a sample by Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (AMS). In reality, the amount of isotope in a sample is not only a function of exposure age, but also erosion rate and inheritance; when making only one isotopic measurement, two of these unknowns must be estimated. However, measuring multiple isotopes produces multiple equations (one for each isotope) that allow simultaneous solution for more than one variable. In addition to exposure age, burial time can be determined by measuring the decay of two isotopes in sediment that is no longer accumulating cosmogenic isotopes as it is shielded by the sediment above.</p>

"7","Nutrients and Data Synthesis, Mass Balance","<p>

  Collect and synthesize the available information on the annual amounts of nutrients, major ions, salts and metals, being transported into and out of the CAP LTER urban area in surface water, as well as stored in or lost from groundwaters. Monitor surface water concentrations of major nutrients and ions over time in the main input and output channels. Quantify the soil pools and develop mass balances for major nutrients. Understand how urbanization is altering biogeochemical cycling and storage.

</p>

",NULL,"<p>The goal of this project is to develop preliminary mass balances for nitrogen and salts in the Phoenix LTER watershed. Nitrogen is important because it is a limiting nutrient for plant growth and because there is widespread nitrate contamination of groundwater in the Phoenix area. Much of the groundwater in the Phoenix area already exceeds the EPA drinking water limit and many wells have been shut down for this reason. Salts are being studied because a buildup of salts is occurring in the Phoenix ecosystem. Salt buildup in soils or groundwater may eventually reduce plant productivity.</p>


<p>The mass balances include external inputs (surface water, groundwater, atmospheric deposition, fertilizer, food, etc.), outputs (surface and groundwater; human exports, etc.), and accumulation (landfills, surficial soils, vadose zone, groundwater). </p>

<p>Key questions be addressed are:</p>

<p>1. What is the net retention of salts and nitrogen in the Phoenix ecosystem?</p>

<p>2. How much salt and nitrogen is exported from the Phoenix ecosystem via the Gila River? Is downstream export higher than upstream inputs?</p>

<p>3. How have changes in population and land use (e.g., a shift from agricultural production to urban development) affected accumulation rates of these materials?</p>

<p>4. How does accumulation of these materials vary spatially, in relation to land use?</p>

<p>Some very preliminary conclusions: major sources of N are fertilizer, animal waste, and municipal sewage (mostly recycled within system), and atmospheric deposition. Surface and groundwater inputs are small by comparison. Nitrogen retention is probably very high; accumulation occurs in groundwater and probably in the vadose zone. Movement through the vadose zone probably occurs on a time scale of several decades.</p>

  Surface Water Monitoring plan

</p>
<p>

  The surface water quality monitoring sites have been located to meet the following criteria: (a) to characterize the main inputs to and outputs from the CAP LTER study area; (b) to correspond to the sites sampled by the USGS National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program wherever possible; and (c) to be as close as possible to established gauging stations, so that annual or per event loads can be estimated. At several of the sites, CAP LTER sampling will augment between 3 and 40 years of data collection by NAWQA and previous USGS water sampling programs, enabling past changes in materials flow to be compared with current and future data. The LTER core monitoring program consists of 7 sites where surface water flow occurs all year round. These sites will be sampled 10-12 times a year, usually at monthly intervals, although the exact frequency of sample collection will be weighted according to flow, so that more samples are collected during high flow periods. The core monitored sites are:

</p>
<p>

  Input Sites

</p>
<p>

  The Salt and VerdeRivers represent the major natural inflows to the CAP study area; both drain watersheds which are dominantly undeveloped desert, chaparral or forest. They are sampled separately because they do not mix well above Granite Reef Dam, so it is not possible to get a single representative sample below the confluence.

</p>
<p>

  1. Lower Salt River, sampled adjacent to the gauging station at the Blue Point Bridge below the Stewart Mountain Dam (not at the NAWQA site at the Roosevelt Dam) so as to obtain a sample that is representative of the water entering the city system at Granite Reef.

</p>
<p>

  2. Lower Verde River, sampled at Rio Verde (not at the NAWQA site upstream at Bartlett Dam), this is the closest accessible location to the Beeline gauging station, upstream of the Salt confluence.

</p>
<p>

  3. CAP canal inflow off the Bush Highway just south of Granite Reef. This is the other main inflow to the urban system.

</p>
<p>

  Mid-System/Agricultural Sites

</p>
<p>

  4. 91st Ave Waste Water Treatment Plant (same as NAWQA) the outlet water sampled here constitutes the majority of the water returned to the Salt River channel downstream of the Phoenix metropolitan area. At times when there is also significant flow in the Salt River above the treatment plant outlet, an additional sample is collected in the main river channel adjacent to the outlet culverts.

</p>
<p>

  5. BuckeyeCanal (same as NAWQA) this canal diverts most of the flow from the Salt River below the 91st Ave Treatment Plant to agricultural fields downstream. (Additional water of the same quality is also diverted to the Palo Verde Nuclear Power Plant for cooling; this can account for nearly all the output from the 91st Ave plant in mid summer. The waste water diverted to Palo Verde is all utilized onsite, there is no waste water flow exported from the power plant.).

</p>
<p>

  6. HassyampaRiver (same as NAWQA) is an agricultural integrator site as it drains much of the large agricultural area to the west of Phoenix.

</p>
<p>

  Output Site

</p>
<p>

  7. Gila River at Gillespie Dam (same as NAWQA) is the whole ecosystem integrator site as it represents all the surface water flow for the region.

</p>
<p>

  Additional monitoring sites are located on channels where significant but intermittent surface water flow occurs during periods of heavy rain. Sample collection here is, of necessity, done on an infrequent and opportunistic basis.

</p>
<p>

  Additional Storm Flow Sites

</p>
<p>

  8. Agua FriaRiver at El Mirage, flow in this channel is very infrequent as it is regulated by the outlet from the Lake Pleasant Dam.

</p>
<p>

  9. New River at Glendale Ave represents runoff from a mixed watershed consisting of desert and agriculture in its upper portions and urban areas in the lower part.

</p>
<p>

  10. AC/DC canal at 67th Ave just upstream of its confluence with Skunk Creek/New River, this canal conveys urban storm runoff from NW Phoenix.

</p>
<p>

  11. Cave Creek at Thunderbird Rd, storm flow runoff from a combination of urban and desert areas.

</p>
<p>

  12. Indian Bend Wash at Curry Rd, storm flow runoff from an urban watershed containing a mixture of impervious and pervious urban surfaces (greenbelt and golf courses)

</p>
<p>

  13. Gila River at Maricopa Rd, we are currently negotiating for permission to sample on the Gila River Indian Community land here, during the rare occasions when flow occurs

</p>
<p>

  Water sample collection is carried out using the same basic procedure as the NAWQA program. At each site, a 2 liter sample of water is collected from across the width of the entire channel using a depth-integrated, isokinetic (i.e. water is collected in proportion to the speed of flow in the channel) sampling device. The sample is then split into equal sub-samples in the laboratory and analyzed for nitrogen (nitrate, ammonium, total N, particulate N), carbon (dissolved organic carbon, particulate carbon, total inorganic carbon), phosphorus (soluble reactive phosphate, total P), salts (calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, sulphate), trace metals (e.g. copper, lead, zinc, iron), suspended solids, conductivity and pH. All analyses are done in triplicate, with the inclusion of quality control samples at regular intervals.

</p>
<p>

  


</p>
<p>

  In August 1999 we discontinued sampling at a number of the original sites, to focus on just sites 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 (Lower Salt and Verde, CAP canal input site, 91
st
 Ave and Gillespie Dam). Sampling was continued monthly until November 2004, no samples were collected in December 2004. In January 2005, the sampling frequency was decreased to the current scheme, whereby samples are taken at the 5 sites once every 2 months beginning in January, but with only sites 4 and 7 (91
st
 Ave and Gillespie) dam being sampled in November. In the revised sampling scheme we attempt to adjust the timing to try and collect more samples during high flow periods whenever possible.

</p>
<p>

  In July 2005 we discontinued the practice of taking a cross-channel, depth integrated sample and now just take a dip sample ' since rigorous cross testing of the two methods for several years showed no differences in ion concentrations between the methods.

"9","Lichen Resurvey with Heavy Metal Analysis","
  <p>
    
  Lichens are often used as longterm integrators of elemental deposition patterns.  Previous research by Zschau and Nash in Maricopa County, Arizona has used lichens of the genus Xanthoparmelia to determine sources and trends in elemental deposition patterns for the region, with an emphasis on heavy metals. The purpose of this investigation is to resurvey MaricopaCounty and examine any temporal changes in elemental deposition patterns.  Lichens will be analyzed for elemental content using high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrophotometry (HR ICP MS), which improves the sensitivity relative to the previously used ICP MS, potentially allowing patterns for additional elements to be determined. Comparisons with the previous investigation, as well as analysis of older specimens collected in the county and stored in the ASU Lichen Herbarium, will help to provide a baseline from which temporal trends can be derived. Multivariate and spatial analysis of elemental patterns is expected to yield both current spatial deposition patterns and temporal trends in such elemental deposition for the region.  

  </p>
  <p>
    
  1. General Description

  </p>
  <p>
    
      As long-lived, slow-growing organisms, lichens are useful as surrogate receptors in atmospheric deposition monitoring investigations, where the integration of long-term signals requires monitoring (Nash 1989, Garty 2001). Because they do not possess nutrient absorbing roots, as found in vascular plants, they have a major dependence on atmospheric sources of nutrients (Nieboer et al. 1978, Nieboer and Richardson 1980). Compared to soil nutrient pools, atmospheric concentrations of nutrients are quite low, and consequently nutrient concentrating mechanisms, such as particulate trapping (Garty et al. 1979), uptake to cell wall exchange sites or transport intracellularly (Beckett and Brown 1984; Brown and Beckett 1985), sequestering in complexes formed with lichen secondary metabolites (Purvis et al. 1987) or impaction of aerosols (Knops et al. 1996) are important for lichens.  As a consequence, lichens have often been used as surrogate receptors for atmospheric deposition of radionuclides (e.g. Palmer et al. 1965, Seaward et al. 1988, Biazrov 1994) and various other atmospheric pollutants (Puckett 1988, Nash and Gries 1995). When an appropriate stratified sampling design (e.g. with respect to lichen species choice, microhabitat characteristics, atmospheric exposure, etc.) is employed, then both local and regional deposition patterns are readily discerned (Bruteig 1993, Loppi and Bargagli 1996, Muir et al. 1993, Nash 1996), although care must be taken in the assessment of baseline levels (Gough et al. 1988; Bennett 2000).

  </p>
  <p>
    
      In an earlier investigation Zschau et al. (2003), determined past spatial patterns of atmospheric deposition across Maricopa County, Arizona, in 1998, based on samples from 28 sites, as analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrophotometry (ICP-MS). The county is approximately L-shaped, extending over 200 km along its two longer axes, and contains the Phoenix metropolitan area, one of the fastest growing urban regions in the world. Although heavy industry is minimal within the Phoenix area, Arizona has historically been an important source of copper.  Major sources of spatial elemental variation included copper mining and smelting (in an adjacent county), anthropogenic sources associated with the urban center (e.g. lead) and location of special geological features, such as mafic rocks with elevated concentrations of Co, Cr, Ni, and Sc relative to average abundances in the Earth s crust. In addition, temporal comparisons for six of the same sites within the county were possible, based on collections made in the mid-1970 s (Nash et al. 2003), where sufficient lichen material was available for analysis. Decreases in copper (cessation of smelting) and lead (switch to unleaded gasoline) were demonstrable and increases in zinc (not shown) were found. Because of the success of the earlier investigation, a resurvey of these sites was specifically included in the 2nd round of funding for CAPLTER.

  </p>
  <p>
    
      The genus 
     is selected as the most suitable biomonitor of metal deposition in the MaricopaCounty region, because it is one of the few macrolichens where readily obtaining enough material for analysis is possible in arid areas (Nash et al. 1977). It is easily recognizable in the field, is present at many sites locally, and has previously been used for similar investigations (Zschau et al. 2003; Nash et al. 2003) whereby the sites were sampled in 1998. Spatial patterns of atmospheric deposition of trace elements to these epilithic lichens will be assessed using the same 28 sites investigated previously.

  </p>
  <p>
    
      The lichen material will be cleaned, wet digested and analyzed by a High Resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectophotometer (HR-ICP-MS) for a suite of elemental concentrations (antimony [Sb], cadmium [Cd], cerium [Ce], chromium [Cr], cobalt [Co], copper [Cu], dysprosium [Dy], europium [Eu], gadolinium [Gd], gold [Au], holmium [Ho], lead [Pb], lutetium [Lu], neodymium [Nd], nickel [Ni], palladium [Pd], platinum [Pt], praseodymium [Pr], samarium [Sm], scandium [Sc], silver [Ag], terbium [Tb], thulium [Tm], tin [Sn], uranium [U], vanadium [V], ytterbium [Yb], yttrium [Y], and zinc [Zn]).  The ASU HR-ICP-MS has greater resolution than the ICP-MS used in the earlier investigation; consequently, we anticipate obtaining data for more elements than the 17 elements, for which Zschau (1999) obtained complete data sets (8 other elements were below the detection limits for at least one site). Nevertheless, obtaining complete datasets for all 29 elements listed above is unlikely.

  </p>
  <p>
    
      In the laboratory, lichen thalli of approximately 6-8 cm in diameter will be selected, removed from the rock substrate with plastic forceps and cleaned thoroughly using nano-pure water. This cleaning step, conducted in a laminar flow unit to limit contamination by the prep person, will remove most of the surficial particulates, though some remaining particles  may have to be removed by sonication. The cleaned thalli will be stored in nitric acid-washed beakers until air-dry. To minimize intra-thalline and inter-thalline elemental variation at each sampling site (Loppi and Bargagli 1996), the lichen material will then be frozen with liquid nitrogen, crushed in a clean mortar and pestle, and homogenized. Previous experiments tested elemental recoveries of different digestion procedures (Zschau et al. 2003).  For the lichen samples, conventional wet digestion procedures, using concentrated nitric acid and hydrochloric acid digestion, was selected as the best procedure.  

  </p>
  <p>
    
      Digestion procedures for the HR ICP-MS will have to be developed using techniques from previous work as a starting point.  The student will begin by developing a digestion procedure that does not use hydrochloric acid under the direction of Dr. Shock s staff.  Also available in the laboratory is a MARS 5 microwave digester.  Digestion techniques using the microwave digester will be developed using samples from previous surveys.  The accuracy of the digestion procedure will be checked against the lichen standard obtained from the International Atomic Energy Agency.

  </p>
  <p>
    
      Before quantitative analysis, samples will be spiked with indium (selected because it is mono-isotopic, near the middle of the mass range, and not an element of interest to this study) as an internal calibration standard. Elemental concentrations for a suite of 28 trace metals in each sample will be quantified using high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS).  Blanks will be run along the entire sample preparation procedure and should be uniformly much lower than the replicates from the same location.

  </p>
  <p>
    
      Means of the triplicate, independent digestions per location and their respective standard deviations will be calculated. These parameters and the original data will be made available at http//ces.asu.edu. Using the PC-ORD software (McCune and Mefford 1999), two methods will be employed to examine spatial patterns of elemental concentration of those elements that were above detection levels at all sites. First, the data matrix for the cluster analysis (Ward s method) will be transformed to the sums of standard deviations to reduce the amount of chaining present in the groupings of locations and elements.  Results will be graphed in the form of dendrograms.  Second, principal component analysis (PCA) will be used to reduce dimensionality and explain the main sources of variation, as the initial principal components. Normal probability plots for each principal component will be used to assess the underlying assumption of normality. The final results of the PCA s will be graphed as two- or three-dimensional ordination plots. Furthermore, the results of the PCA s can be further refined by factor analysis to help identify elemental source (e.g. Sloff 1995; Rahn and Huanh 1999).  Surface maps for concentrations of at least cadmium, lead, copper, nickel, and zinc will be interpolated among the locations using ArcGIS Geostatistics and Spatial Analyst packages.  All data files will be converted into UTM 1983, zone 12 format, which offers the best map projection of the target.  The following ArcGIS Geostatistics settings are anticiptated to best resolve the spatial pollution patterns (based on Zschau et al. 1999), and will, therefore, be used to interpolate the surfaces:

  </p>
  <p>
    
  1. Interpolation Mode:  Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW).  The interpolator assumes that input points have a local influence that decreases with distance.

  </p>
  <p>
    
  2. Interpolator settings:  spatial resolution 300 map units, nearest neighbor analysis, 20 points, power = 5, and no barriers. Other workers (Gailey et al. 1985) have modeled pollution patterns using a 4th order polynomial fit.

  </p>
  <p>
    
  The interpolated surfaces will be clipped to the target regions borders using GIS data from the Arizona Land Resource Information System (ALRIS).  Geology, topology, traffic, urbanization, and mining activities will be also evaluated using ALRIS and USGS DEM maps.  Historical industrial emissions for some elements will be collected from the toxic release inventory (TRI) from the US Environmental Protection Agency, and spatial localities indexed to the interpolated maps.  Because the 
     grows on rocks, part of the elemental variation observed in the area will doubtlessly be related to underlying variation in geology and associated blowing dust. Accordingly, it will be necessary to interpret the results in terms of basic knowledge of geochemistry (e.g. Levinson 1974; Taylor and McLennan 1985) as well as specific knowledge of the geochemistry in the region (e.g. Reynolds 1988; Titley and Anthony 1989). Because known pollution sources are present in the region, the results will also have to be interpreted in light of known emission data (e.g. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1997).

Understanding arthropod distributions and how they differ as functions of land use and land cover is important for several reasons. First, arthropods, with their diversity of life strategies, are good indicators of an array of features pertaining to habitat quality. Responses to changes in quality take place quickly due to the short life spans and the specialized requirements of many species. Second, arthropods provide a key link between plant and vertebrate communities so characterizing differences in arthropod assemblages as functions of land use and land cover is a key component of understanding the overall ecology of the urban environment.</p>","<p>Refer to the following url for a description of methods:  http://caplter.asu.edu/data/protocols/?id=22",NULL

  An extensive survey was conducted to assess the species diversity of natural desert vegetation around the CAP-LTER study area. Remnant patch habitats (mostly parks and preserves) occurring within the urban matrix / fringe were emphasized. Three outlying areas (White Tank mountains west of town, Union Hills north of town, and Usery Mountain Park east of town) were surveyed for comparison. The original intent was to provide data on the woody and spring / summer herbaceous species in each area, but drought conditions allowed the spring herbs to be surveyed twice (1998, 2001) and summer herbs surveyed only once (1999). Thus, all locations have woody data but only a subset has herbaceous data. Surveys consisted of transects (elaborated below) summarized by the patch or outlying area name followed by a number (e.g. Unhill-11, Squaw-40, Hayden-8). Herb datasets are signified by a P for spring and a U for summer following the transect number (e.g. PaPk-1P, PaPk-1U).

",NULL,"<p>Open-space land, land set aside for public use in its natural state, is an increasingly important part of the urban environment. Open-space land provides recreation and leisure opportunities for local residents and visitors alike, and also is an important source of purely aesthetic enjoyment. In deciding on the quantity of native land to set aside for public use and enjoyment, it is important for policy makers to have some idea of the value consumers derive from the amenities associated with its public use. The purpose of this study is to provide empirical estimates of the economic value of open-space land; that is, the value individuals place on living near and having access to land that has been preserve in its native state for public use. Working under the auspices of the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research (CAP LTER) Project, our study focuses on the economic benefits of open-space lands within and around the Phoenix metropolitan area, namely those lands set aside by the government as natural parks that fall within, or border upon, Maricopa County. Since individual valuations underlie all market prices, this study attempts to determine individuals' willingness-to-pay for the amenities associated with open-space areas through an analysis of the primary factors that determine land prices. The main problem that arises in undertaking such an investigation is that it is difficult to determine the value of individual site characteristics, since these characteristics are not separately traded nor are they priced in explicit (i.e., separate) markets.</p>

A more complete picture of ecological change in CAP LTER will emerge as historical land use data is put into GIS format, analyzed, and brought into service of the patch dynamic model. Identifying historical rural/urban conversion rates and trends will provide a baseline of data against which current and future trends and rates will be compared and analyzed. For example, a visual survey of historical air photos of the CAP LTER area indicates that municipalities currently contiguous were once physically separate and distant entities. Scanning and digitizing historical air photographs and other land use database resources will allow us to capture the growth of cities over time, the subsequent loss of rural and desert land, and provide us with a baseline explanation of how and where such growth occurs. In turn, this baseline data will allow us to identify trends which will flesh out further lines of inquiry.</p>

Our first line of action is scanning air photographs from 1934 available in the Salt River Project (SRP) archives. The next set we hope to work with is from the 1960s. With current 1997 data already available to us, we will shortly have a data set dating back 60+ years, in 30-year increments.

<p>

  This project will expand the developing land classification techniques using new analytical techniques and other remote sensing images as they become available. This will provide multiyear increments for spatial change models and overlap with U.S. census information.

</p>
<p>
Datasets for Land Cover, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) are produced on a regular schedule as appropriate remote sensing scenes become available.
</p>


","<p>Research involves parcel and metropolitan level classification. Contact CAP Information Manager for details.</p>

","<p>Land cover type, the primary product of remote-sensing classification, is a fundamental data set for nearly every aspect of the CAP LTER project. Already, it has been used to derive surface cover, aid in biological surveys, plan future science initiatives, and help define the patch typology of the system. The pilot project is currently using 1993 Landsat TM multispectral data to test and refine classification schemes for the urban, desert, and fringe regional of the CAP LTER. These classes, once accurately defined and field checked, will be form the basis of the LTER's patch typology and serve as a past baseline on the ground cover inventory of the Phoenix metropolitan area.</p>

<p>To examine the temporal effects of urban growth and its impact on the desert ecology, it is critical to have data extending both into the past as well as the future. Past remote-sensing data is needed for patch and change modeling. It will take advantage of spatial patterns prior to large influxes of population and the subsequent change from agriculturally dominated to urban-dominated land cover. Data collected in the future will also provide a monitoring and projecting ability for the science team. More importantly, these data can be used to direct new and alter existing field projects within the CAP LTER. Because this data product will be constantly changing as urban growth continues, it is important to monitor and analyze these changes, as well as link them to land use and socioeconomic change.</p>

<p>By expanding the remote-sensing analysis and data archive for the CAP LTER project we can extend the land cover classification to form a 60-year historic land cover inventory for Phoenix. This will provide the basis for multithematic, multitemporal, and multispatial scale research.</p>

<p>Some research questions critical to the LTER science objectives which can be answered with the expansion of the data, both past and future, are:</p>

<p>What is the distribution and variability of land cover classes in the Valley over time?</p>

<p>How do these distributions change over time and by urban location? Are there single or multiple sequences? How do these changes relate to population expansion?</p>

<p>What is the effect of this change on remote sensing, ecological, land use, and land value theoretical models?</p>

<p>Can growth and economical change be monitored precisely with future data and how well can trends be identified based on projections of past data?</p>

",NULL,"<p>Insects that pollinate flowering plants are often considered ""keystone species,"" animals that play extremely important roles in ecosystem functioning such that their absence would have more widespread and far-reaching effects than their abundance alone would indicate. For example, the absence of pollinating insects would translate to a severe reduction in plant reproduction, which would in turn affect not only the plants but also seed-eating animals, herbivorous animals, predators of the herbivores, and so on in a trophic cascade. Such a scenario would impact not only wildlife but also human populations because insects pollinate the majority of human food-plants. While the importance of these relationships is acknowledged, surprisingly, little is known about how insect pollinator communities are affected by environmental changes, such as global climate change or urban development. There has recently been a call for research on insect pollinator communities, citing a pressing need to obtain baseline information in the face of probable future environmental changes.</p>

<p>The Sonoran Desert has one of the most diverse insect communities in the world (particularly for members of the Order Hymenoptera [bees, wasps, and ants], which perform the lion's share of pollination duties for both native and crop plants).

(2) How does insect pollinator community structure (richness and abundance) differ among natural desert, urban desert remnants, and residential areas? and (3) How does insect pollinator community structure differ with different residential horticultural practices (xeriscaping with native plants vs. watered lawns with exotic species)?</p>

The study is designed, particularly, to answer the question: to what extent are concentrations and fluxes of these ions enhanced within the urban core relative to the undeveloped desert. As part of this monitoring, the CAP LTER maintains two wet-dry collectors, one each at an urban location (Arizona State University (ASU), Tempe, AZ) and outlying desert area (Lost Dutchman State Park, Apache Junction, AZ); an additional bulk-deposition (wet+dry) collector is maintained at the Tempe location for comparison across the LTER network.

<p>Urbanization has profound effects on animals, from the community to the individual level. The human constructed environments found in the city support altered food web structure, behavior, physiology, and trajectories of evolution.  This project focuses on birds as a sentinel group of animals, revealing effects of a wide variety of human activities from gardening and feeding wildlife at the local scale to broader scale planning and policy actions that influence the distribution of open space. We aim to monitor bird species diversity, abundance, and community composition over time in representative habitat types across the Phoenix metropolitan area and in the surrounding desert. This dataset helps to address central questions of the CAP LTER project: How do human activities, behaviors, and values change biodiversity and its components—population abundance, species distribution and richness, and community and trophic structure?   In turn, how do variations in biodiversity feed back to influence these same human values, perceptions, and actions? This foundational dataset supports many other avian research projects by providing basic information on bird community structure from sites across the city, co-located with other long term monitoring sites, including Survey200 and PASS. Ultimately, we aim to provide insight into management actions that can be taken to enhance biodiversity in the city while also supporting a high quality of life for humans. 


</p>","<p>Bird monitoring is conducted during two seasons, winter and spring, in order to capture the full range of species occurring in the Phoenix metropolitan region – both resident and seasonal migrants. We use an unlimited radius point count protocol, with 15 minute counts. All birds seen and heard in the 15 minute window are recorded along with their estimated distance from the observer, whether they were seen, heard, or both, and whether or not they were flying through. Three observers visit each point in each season, for a total of 6 visits to each site per year. Forty sites each are co-located with Survey200 and PASS sampling. Survey200 sites are sampled every year while PASS sites are sampled for 2 consecutive years at the time of each PASS survey (every 5 years). Following the Survey200 sampling design, the sites were randomly selected without reference to habitat type. Post hoc classification of the sampling sites revealed the presence of most of the major habitat types in the Phoenix metropolitan region in the sample. However, riparian areas were under-sampled.

"36","Bruchid Beetle Study","<p></p>

",NULL,"<p>Urbanization can have strong effects on communities of native herbivorous insects.  We are studying the community of insects that live in the seedpods of the blue palo verde, Cercidium floridum.  These communities include three species of bruchid beetles that eat seeds (Coleoptera: Bruchidae), their natural enemies (parasitic and predatory insects), and other insects that use the pods as shelter. We are particularly interested in finding out what determines the population density of the bruchids. The success of a herbivorous insect can be influenced by the characteristics of the plants on which they feed, and the natural enemies that attack them. The urban environments, in which many palo verde now grow, are very different from their natural desert environment. Urban plants may receive different amounts of fertilizer, water, and pesticide and be exposed to many other changes in their environment compared to the desert environment. This has the potential to alter the seeds on which the bruchids feed and influence their survival. In addition the plant community in the city is highly altered from that in the desert.  Humans plant palo verde trees in a very different spatial distribution from their normal distribution. They are also mixed in with many exotic species that may offer alternate food sources for the bruchids.  This change in the plant community can alter the searching behavior of the bruchids and alter the distribution of eggs among trees.</p>     

<p>The distribution and abundance bruchids can also be strongly influenced by environmental changes that influence their natural enemies. Natural enemies can be affected directly by human activities such as pesticide use. They can also be indirectly affected by changes in the host plant.  Host plant characteristics often determine whether natural enemies can successfully find and attack their hosts.  We hypothesize that changes in the palo verde may determine how susceptible the bruchids that feed on them are to parasitic wasps and predatory insects.  Changes in the distribution of palo verde and in the plant community in which they are found from desert to urban sites may also influence the ability of these natural enemies to locate their bruchid hosts. </p>

<p>To measure how urbanization has influenced this plant-insect-natural enemy interaction we are comparing these insect communities in urban and desert areas.  We are also measuring environmental and palo verde characteristics in these areas to determine what mechanisms are responsible for changes in the bruchid community.  An important part of our research is participation of students and teachers in helping collect data through the Ecology Explorers program.  Students can access information about how to participate in this program through the Ecology Explorers page (http://caplter.asu.edu/explorers) on the LTER web site.</p>

"37","Spatial/Temporal Change of Climate/Air Quality in Relation to Urban Fringe Development",NULL,NULL,"<p>Background</p>

<p>     Not many studies have documented climate and air quality changes of settlements at early
stages of development. This is because high quality climate and air quality records are deficient
for the periods of the early 18th century to mid 20th century when many U.S. cities were formed and grew (Karl et al. 1988). Dramatic landscape change induces substantial local climate change during the incipient stage of development. Rapid growth along the urban fringe in Phoenix, coupled with a fine-grained climate monitoring system, provide a unique opportunity to study the climate impacts of urban development as it unfolds.</p>

<p>     Generally, heat islands form, particularly at night, in proportion to city population size and
morphological characteristics. Drier air is produced by replacement of the countryside's moist
landscapes with dry, hot urbanized surfaces. Wind is increased due to turbulence induced by the
built-up urban fabric and its morphology; although, depending on spatial densities of buildings on
the land, wind may also decrease. Air quality conditions are worsened due to increased city
emissions and surface disturbances. Depending on the diversity of microclimates in pre-existing
rural landscapes and the land-use mosaic in cities, the introduction of settlements over time and
space can increase or decrease the variety of microclimates within and near urban regions. These differences in microclimatic conditions can influence variations in health, ecological, architectural, economic, energy and water resources, and quality-of-life conditions in the city. Therefore, studying microclimatic conditions which change in the urban fringe over time and space is at the core of urban ecological goals as part of LTER aims (Greenland and Swift 1991).</p>

<p>     In analyzing Phoenix and Baltimore long-term rural/urban weather and climate stations,
Brazel et al. (In progress) have discovered that long-term (i.e., 100 years) temperature changes do
not correlate with populations changes in a linear manner, but rather in a third-order nonlinear
response fashion. This nonlinear temporal change is consistent with the theories in boundary layer climatology that describe and explain the leading edge transition and energy balance theory (Oke 1987). This pattern of urban vs. rural temperature response has been demonstrated by Karl et al. (1988) in relation to spatial range of city sizes (using population data) for 305 rural vs. urban climate stations in the U.S. Our recent work on the two urban LTER sites has shown that a similar climate response pattern also occurs over time for climate stations that were initially located in rural locations have been overrun bu the urban fringe and subsequent urbanization (e.g., stations in Baltimore, Mesa, Phoenix, and Tempe).</p>

<p>Research Question</p>

<p>     Lack of substantial numbers of weather and climate stations in cities has previously
precluded small-scale analyses of geographic variations of urban climate, and the links to land-use change processes. With the advent of automated weather and climate station networks, remote-sensing technology, land-use history, and the focus on urban ecology, researchers can now analyze local climate responses as a function of the details of land-use change.</p>

<p>     Therefore, the basic research question of this study is: How does urban climate change over time and space at the place of maximum disturbance on the urban fringe?</p>

<p>Hypotheses</p>

<p>1.   Based on the leading edge theory of boundary layer climate change, largest changes
should occur during the period of peak development of the land when land is being rapidly
transformed from open desert and agriculture to residential, commercial, and industrial
uses.</p>

<p>2.   One would expect to observe, on average and on a temporal basis (several years),
nonlinear temperature and humidity alterations across the station network at varying levels
of urban development.</p>

<p>3.   Based on past research on urban climate, one would expect to see in areas of the urban
fringe, rapid changes in temperature (increases at night particularly), humidity (decreases
in areas from agriculture to urban; increases from desert to urban), and wind speed
(increases due to urban heating).</p>

<p>4.   Changes of the surface climate on the urban fringe are expected to be altered as a function
of various energy, moisture, and momentum control parameters, such as albedo, surface
moisture, aerodynamic surface roughness, and thermal admittance. These parameters
relate directly to population and land-use change (Lougeay et al. 1996).</p>

<p>5.   Air quality trends of particulates, ozone, and CO along the urban fringe will be a function
of land surface disturbance, traffic patterns, and commercial development in concert with
alterations in the surface climate, particularly wind regime and low-level atmospheric
stability changes.</p>

"38","Prediction Model of the Presence of Bedrock Pediments Vs. Alluvial Slopes","<p>This project is a doctoral dissertation project through the Department of Geography, Arizona State University, and is an associated CAP LTER project.</p>

",NULL,"<p> Population growth is occurring in the desert Southwest at an increasing rate and Phoenix, Arizona, is one notable recipient of this growth. Phoenix has recently become the sixth largest city in the nation within the country's fastest growing county. The city is expanding out of its valley and residential and commercial developments are being built near the mountains that surround it to meet this growth and satisfy the desire of many people to live in more ""pristine"" rural areas.</p>

<p> Common to the southern Arizona landscape are pediments. Pediments are gently sloping bedrock platforms of low relief emanating from a mountain front, and are commonly viewed as the ""conveyor belt"" upon which sediment moves down from the eroding mountain to the alluvial plain below. As they are bedrock features, pediments provide sound foundations to build upon and, along with their location, are desirable locations for development.</p>

<p>Many mountain fronts in southern Arizona, however, are not composed of pediments but alluvial fans. An alluvial fan is a cone-shaped deposit of alluvium made by ephemeral mountain streams depositing sediment on the piedmont. In contrast to pediments, alluvial fans are less stable as a foundation of building. Alluvial fans are prone to problems such as flooding, channel migration, and sediment buildup. These processes cause damage to homes, utility infrastructure, and landscape development by undermining structures and eroding or burying developed landscapes.</p>

<p>The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine what controls the presence of bedrock pediments. The bedrock pediment is a ""true"" pediment in that the bedrock bench visibly emanates from the mountain base. An ""alluvial slope"" may have a bedrock bench present somewhere underneath flood deposits. With the bedrock buried under up to several meters of sediments though, the alluvial slope behaves more like an alluvial fan.</p>

<p>My goal is to develop and test a model that predicts the presence of bedrock pediments versus alluvial slopes. The model will be based on field and laboratory measurements of geomorphic indicators from specific sites. These indicators include particle size variation between the inselberg slope and pediment or alluvial slope, joint and vegetation density on the inselberg slope, the break-in-slope angle of the pediment/mountain junction, and the drainage basin area for the pediment and the alluvial slope. The laboratory data will originate from digital elevation models, aerial photographs, and Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery imported into a geographic information system. The model will consist of a multiple regression of the relationships among the data gathered both in the field and through geographic information techniques. After building the model, I will test its precision by using it to predict the occurrence of pediments or alluvial slopes at other locations. This model will provide for a more informed decision regarding area suitable for development by determining the presence of bedrock pediments and alluvial slopes.</p>

"40","A River Used to Run Through It: Water Use and Flooding in Phoenix",NULL,NULL,"<p>The winter of 1979-80 brought unusually large amounts of warm rain to Arizona. By mid-February, the heavy rains had saturated the ground and nearly filled the reservoirs to the northeast and northwest of Phoenix. The normally dry riverbeds of the Salt River and the Agua Fria became raging torrents, and experts warned that conditions might bring a 500-year flood down on the city. Governor Bruce Babbitt declared a state of emergency in Maricopa County and warned of a possible evacuation of some 200,000 people. Luckily for the citizens of Phoenix the rains quit and the evacuation did not occur. Even still, the floods of February 1980 did extensive damage. Greatest damage occurred along the Salt River in the greater Phoenix area. Floodwaters and debris destroyed or damaged 11 of 13 bridges or crossing of the Salt River, turning the daily flow of tens of thousands of vehicles into a motorist's nightmare. At rush hour cars waited 3-6 hours to cross the river.</p>

<p>The idea of flooding in the desert metropolis of Phoenix may seem incongruous, especially when one considers that the average rainfall in the Phoenix area is &lt;8 inches a year. The Salt River flows through the southern part of the urbanized area, the Agua Fria and the Verde River flow from the north and constitute the western and northwestern boundaries of the area, and the Gila River flows through the southwestern portion of the metropolitan region and receives the flow of the Salt River and the Agua Fria. The Gila River continues westward towards the Colorado River. The area drained by these rivers extends as far north as the San Francisco Peaks, east to the Continental Divide in New Mexico, and south into Mexico. The higher elevated portions of this drainage area receive significantly greater precipitation than Phoenix. Due to this combination of physiography and climate, flooding as a natural process has occurred in the Phoenix area since long before the city's founding.</p>

<p>Because of events like the floods of 1980 -- and because the potential for flooding still exists -- it is important to understand the history of flooding in the Phoenix metropolitan area. Integral to that history is how humans have interacted with the natural process of flooding. Most of the rivers mentioned above would flow continuously through the Phoenix area were it not for major upstream dams and reservoirs. These dams are designed and operated primarily to capture surface water for water supply, and as a result, the riverbeds in the city are normally dry. How have dams, canals, and diversions changed the nature and frequency of floods? What other human actions, such as floodplain development or watershed land use have affected flooding? What steps have humans taken to control or prevent rising water and destructive floods? How have the almost continual growth of the city since World War II and the expansion of roads, homes, and businesses into new areas affected the risk of destructive floods? What impact have floods, or the lack thereof, had on the overall ecosystem of the Phoenix metropolitan area? The answers to these questions will lead to a better understanding of how humans have interacted with -- and continue to interact with -- nature in this area of the Southwest.</p>

<p>The purpose of this study is to examine the history of flooding in the Phoenix metropolitan area through the lens of environmental history. The importance of water to the West forms one of the major themes in the region's history, and this research will look at this vital resource from a novel perspective. Rather than focus only on how humans have manipulated and moved and controlled water -- although this is certainly part of the story -- this study will focus on those times when the water failed to cooperate. Thus, floods in many ways will provide the organization for this study and be featured as prominently as dams, reservoirs, canals, and people.<p>"
"41","Phoenix Area Social Survey","<p>The Phoenix Area Social Survey (PASS) is a survey of heads of households, ages 18 years and older, in the Phoenix metropolitan area. It is designed to help understand how human behavior shapes the dynamics of central Arizona’s urban socioecological system, including the feedbacks of ecosystem processes to human health and well-being.  The 30-minute survey asks respondents more than 100 questions about their perceptions, values, and behaviors concerning climate change, water, land use, air quality, biodiversity, and health.  PASS has been administered three times: a) 302 respondents in eight neighborhoods in 2001-2002, b) 808 respondents in 40 neighborhoods, including the original eight neighborhoods, in 2006, and c) 806 respondents in 45 neighborhoods, including all 40 previously surveyed neighborhoods, in 2011. The next administration of the survey will be in 2016.  This longitudinal design enables us to track changes in the population’s attitudes and behaviors in five-year intervals and serves as an important component of CAP LTER’s long-term monitoring program.

 </p>","<p>From the first through the most recent administrations of the survey, PASS has used a multi-level sampling strategy in order to accommodate the needs of scientists with diverse research goals.  Samples of neighborhoods were selected from the urbanized field sites of Survey 200 and other strategic CAP LTER research sites. Neighborhood boundaries were defined by U.S. Census block groups and our selection of the sample neighborhoods represents socioeconomic and rural-urban gradients. Random samples of households were selected from the addresses of enumerated occupied dwellings within each census block group.  Addresses from the 2006 household sample were retained in the 2011 sample.  Respondents chose to complete the survey online or with the assistance of an interviewer on the telephone or in person.  All respondents were offered an incentive for completing the survey and special outreach efforts were made to increase response rates among Spanish-speakers and people with low educational attainment in the 2011 survey.  All three waves of PASS spatially link household survey responses with the most recently available population characteristics of census block groups.  Ancillary spatially explicit datasets, such as land cover, temperature, air quality, and water consumption have been joined to PASS in order to conduct various analyses at the scales of parcel and block group.  The sampling strategy and the geographical linkages with other datasets make PASS an important vehicle for interdisciplinary collaborations among CAP LTER social and biophysical scientists.</p>",NULL
"42","Gender and Racial/Ethnic Inequality in Postindustrial Urban Labor Markets: A Spatial and Sectoral Analysis of Employment Changes","<p>Economic restructuring is characterized as the shift in employment from manufacturing to services and the spatial migration of jobs out of central cities.  The history of the United States has been one of increasing standard of living, and economic restructuring benefits the country as a whole.  However, social scientists argue that not all segments of society benefit equally from this economic transformation.  There is little research that explicitly investigates the effects of the new economy on gender and racial/ethnic inequalities.</p>

",NULL,"<p>This research will measure the effects of changes in the location and types of employment opportunities on gender and racial/ethnic inequality in urban labor markets.   Specifically, we will study the effects of relocation and restructuring on women's and minorities' employment levels, occupational segregation, wages, and the socioeconomic condition of urban neighborhoods.  Many argue that the geographic movement of jobs from central cities to the suburbs has increased inequality because the new locations are inaccessible to city residents.  Similarly, as the national industrial and occupational profile is reshuffled in favor of the service sector, it is thought that the economic standing of minorities and women may change with respect to one or more indicator of employment equity.</p>
<p>Measuring the impact of these changes is complicated because economic changes are not occurring uniformly in different parts of the country.  Much social science research in the 1980s and early 1990s focused on economic decline in the East without considering the growing economies of the South and West.  To overcome this problem, we will trace the spatial relocation of firms and the economic restructuring of major industrial sectors and occupations over a 15-year period (1983-1997 or most recent year available) in the Phoenix, AZ and Baltimore, MD Metropolitan Statistical Areas.  As a thriving Sunbelt city, Phoenix has experienced rapid job growth in nearly all major industries.  Baltimore fits the more typical pattern of deindustrialization in the Northeast in which manufacturing employment declined through the 1970s and 1980s.  By studying these two areas, we can compare two sets of economic conditions that both characterize the national experience in recent years.  This will help us understand more precisely the processes that are related to changes in inequality among sociodemographic groups.</p>

</p>

",NULL,"An initial nitrogen mass balance for the CAP LTER ecosystem suggests that between 15 and 40 kg ha-1 y-1 of N is retained somewhere in the ecosystem (excess of inputs over outputs; Baker et al. in revision). The mostly poorly constrained terms of the mass balance that could account for this apparent retention are denitrification, accumulation in the vadose zone and soils, and fate of combustion-derived NOx. The question of where in the landscape N (and other elements, especially C) is retained is best answered using a hierarchical, patch dynamics approach that incorporates both aquatic and terrestrial components of the landscape. Given the size and complexity of the CAP LTER study area, an initial focus on a single, smaller watershed is warranted.

This research is framed mainly from the original proposal sections on nutrients (Section D) and disturbance (Section E), specifically: spatial and temporal variability in exports, material transport in small watersheds during storms, effects on recipient systems, and flood disturbance.

"46","The Effects of Urbanization on Reproduction in Birds","
<p>

  Habitat changes affect the behavior and physiology of individual birds, influencing their survival and reproduction, and in turn affecting population levels. This project will investigate the physiological correlates of habitat change in select native and non-native bird species by sampling birds at different locations along a desert-to-urban habitat gradient. It is one of the first studies to address the mechanisms causing changes in bird populations following urbanization. Results should help us better understand what happens to birds in the Phoenix area as their habitat changes from natural desert to suburban and urban habitats. Such an understanding will be crucial in informing and managing the further growth of the Phoenix metro area in ways that maintain and enhance desired natural and biological values.The focus will be on monitoring seasonal changes in the general body condition of the birds, as well as in levels of reproductive and stress-related hormones, and blood-borne parasites using techniques that do not cause significant harm to the birds.

</p>

",NULL,"Urban development in the Phoenix metro Area is rapidly transforming native desert habitats in ways that have strong effects on local bird communities. The CAP-LTER bird project focuses on documenting these effects in an effort to understand the dynamics of changes in bird species diversity and abundance. Pilot surveys over the past several years have provided basic information such as the species composition and distribution of bird communities in different habitats. Preliminary results indicate that a number of non-native urban species (e.g., House Sparrow, Rock Dove, Inca Dove) have established large populations in the urban habitats. The native bird species show a mixed response: many species (e.g., Cactus Wren, Curve-billed Thrasher, House Finch) appear to be doing well in the city with high densities in some areas; some desert specialists (e.g., Black-throated Sparrow, Phainopepla), on the other hand, are no longer found in urban habitats. We have initiated long-term censuses of bird populations across the whole area to monitor changes in the distribution and abundance of both native and non-native species. This study addresses the mechanisms behind such population and community level changes."

  Fourteen simulated landscape plots containing six replications of two landscape shrub taxa, Nerium oleander  Sister Agnus  and Leucophyllum frutescens var. green cloud,  were treated with a factorial arrangement of two drip irrigation rates (high and low) and four pruning practices (frequent sheared every six weeks, hedged every six months, severely pruned once a year, or not pruned at all). The fourteen plots also contained Rosmarinus officinalis, Eucalyptus microtheca  Blue Ghost , and Quercus virginiana var. fusiformis which were drip irrigated at either high or low rates.

<p>

  Our central objective is to use small, neighborhood parks in Phoenix to study: (1) the ways in which ecological processes are influenced by human values, use, and management; and (2) the ways in which human attitudes and activities, and the services valued by humans, are influenced by ecological characteristics and processes. Elucidating this coupling in Phoenix parks will itself be a significant step towards understanding the complexities of human-nature interactions. The information gathered in addressing the central objective, though, can and should be used to assess potential trajectories for ecological processes. Our second objective is to develop trajectories for potential changes in ecosystem services in the Phoenix metropolitan area, given economic and demographic trends, and given the signal of human-nature interactions among different social groups.

"53","Using Leaves as Samplers to Determine the Spatial Distribution of Atmospheric Particles","<p>One technique that has been used to analyze individual atmospheric particles is automated electron microscopy. This technique gives the size, shape, and elemental composition of individual particles and has been used successfully for particles collected on filters in particle samplers. The goal of the current project is to mimic this electron microscopy analysis technique for particles deposited on leaf surfaces. Preliminary results demonstrate that electron microscopy can be used successfully to analyze individual particles on leaf surfaces. </p>
<p>The ability to analyze atmospheric particles on leaf surfaces leads to a specific application: determining the spatial distribution of atmospheric particles throughout urban areas, namely Phoenix. Evidence from past studies in Phoenix indicate that the distribution of particle types is non-uniform, and sampling with a limited number of particle samplers is not adequate for capturing this variability. Using leaves gives the ability to sample in more locations. In a preliminary study, three sampling locations from the Phoenix area - a desert, an urban, and a suburban site - were chosen as test sites to determine whether different particle types could be observed on leaf surfaces from the different sites. The particle types from the desert site contain only elements comprising desert dust. The particle types from the urban and suburban sites consist partially of elements found in desert dust, but they also contain sulfur, which is likely from anthropogenic sources within the urban area. These preliminary results indicate that the distribution of particle types throughout an urban area can be determined from the analysis of particles on leaf surfaces.</p>
<p>A more detailed study is in progress. Leaves from twenty-eight sampling sites around the Phoenix area have been collected and will be analyzed with a method similar to that used in the preliminary study. The twenty-eight sites were chosen based on land-use data. In addition to determining the spatial distribution of particle types, another objective of this work correlate the particle types with the land-use data from which they were collected.</p>

"61","Natural Ecosystem Responses to Urbanization Effects Along an Urban - Rural Gradient","
<p>

  Urban cities present dynamic systems in which to study the effect that humans and land-use changes have on ecosystem processes. Urbanization results directly in the destruction or fragmentation of surrounding natural and agricultural ecosystems. Indirectly these ecosystems are affected through urban pollutant deposition, climate change, etc. The magnitude of these effects can be quantified through comparisons with rural andldquocontrolandrdquo sites (McDonnell and Pickett 1990, Groffman et al. 1995). Urbanization exposes the entire ecosystem to altered climate, including elevated CO2 levels, increased temperatures from the urban andldquoheat islandandrdquo, changes in precipitation patterns, and increased nitrogen (N) availability. The effects from urban-caused climate change may result in significant change in natural ecosystem processes, such as carbon sequestration or release.

</p>
<p>

  Using an urban to rural framework, I will evaluate the effects of urbanization on the structure and function of desert ecosystems. The objectives of this study are to determine how urbanization changes the C dynamics and the above- and belowground responses to changes in water and N availability. This study will also quantify the sources of CO2 in an urban ecosystem

</p>
<p>

  Sites selected to evaluate urbanization effects on desert ecosystems are grouped into three categories: urban, urban fringe, and rural. At select sites in each category, soil and air temperature, ambient CO2 levels, continuous soil moisture, N deposition, and soil C:N ratios will be monitored. Aboveground productivity using growth measurements, specific leaf mass and leaf C:N ratio will be measured at all plots. At select sites, belowground productivity will be determined by using root in-growth bags placed at the edge of the canopy at the beginning of the project, and then excavating them at six-month intervals during the project. Soil respiration at all sites will be determined using an Infrared Gas Analyzer with a soil CO2 flux chamber. Soil respiration rates will be measured from under the canopy and in non-vegetated interplant spaces when applicable. One site from each category will receive supplemental water and N in both winter and summer seasons. In conjunction with water and N additions, available NO3- and NH4+, and microbial biomass C and N will also be determined. In addition, sources of CO2 from the Phoenix Metropolitan Area were determined through direct soil CO2 efflux measurements, as well as government and NGO sources. The CO2 emissions were quantified and the spatial pattern of CO2 emissions was shown using a GIS-based approach.

</p>
<p>

  This study will contribute to the understanding of the effects of urbanization on desert ecosystems and native landscapes. It will also provide an increased understanding of the role of CO2, temperature, precipitation and nitrogen on the carbon dynamics and mechanisms of ecosystem processes of desert ecosystems, and how they may respond to increased urbanization pressure and predicted global change. In addition, quantification and documentation of the sources of CO2 in an urban area will provide important information in assembling the carbon budget for the Phoenix metropolitan region.

"62","Trophic Structure and Dynamics Experiment","
<p>

  A central and long-pondered question in ecology is: what controls trophic relationships and structure in communities? Theory and empirical studies show that both top-down (e.g., predators) and bottom-up (resource availability and quality) forces influence community structure and trophic dynamics to varying degrees, depending on herbivore and predator or parasite species composition, intraguild predation, spatiotemporal variation in environmental resources and plant competition. In most studies purporting to explain roles of top-down and bottom-up forces in plant-herbivore-natural enemy communities, human activities are ignored, especially outside the realm of agriculture. This is an unfortunate omission, as one of the most intensive and expanding human activities, urbanization, alters top-down and bottom-up forces in dramatic ways, but rarely has been incorporated into studies of trophic dynamics and food webs.

</p>
<p>

  We have begun to experimentally test the effects of vertebrate (birds) and ground-dwelling vertebrate and invertebrate predators, combined with manipulated resources (water) in series of experiments in a semi-arid, urban environment and in outlying desert regions within the CAP region. The focal plant species, Encelia farinosa (brittlebush), is a native Sonoran desert plant that is also widely used as a xeriscaping plant. A replicated, full-factorial experiment established at three sites (a mesic yard (PH), a desert remnant (DBG), and outlying natural desert area) includes four treatments: 1) netting (to exclude vertebrate predators), 2) ring barriers (to exclude ground-dwelling invertebrate predators, 3) supplemental water, and 4) controls (no caging, ring barriers, or supplemental water). We determine (bimonthly) plant productivity, leaf damage, abundances and diversity of herbivores, predators and parasitoids. We will also conduct similar experiments at the scale of entire yards and neighborhoods (24 native and non-native xeriscapes, mesic, and oasis (intermediate) yards) at the NDV experimental suburb. Here, the yard type is manipulated and controlled, and we can examine the consequences for trophic structure and diversity on a common plant species, brittlebush.

</p>
<p>

  We know that urbanization radically alters abundances and diversity of arthropods predators and herbivores, birds, and resource availability from ongoing, complimentary long-term monitoring studies associated with the CAP LTER. These additional experiments will: 1) determine the relative effect of top-down forces (avian, lizard, and invertebrate predators) from less to more human-dominated environments (outlying deserts, desert remnants, xeric and mesic yards) on invertebrate herbivore and predator abundances and diversity, and plant growth, 2) test the relative effect of bottom-up forces (plant productivity) on invertebrate herbivore and predator abundances and diversity, and 3) test the interaction between predation and productivity on herbivore abundances and diversity. Preliminary results indicate that diversity and abundances of arthropod herbivores, predators and parasites differs dramatically among the sites and with season. Furthermore, top-down effects, especially from avian predators, are more pronounced in mesic urban habitats, whereas bottom-up forces (e.g., plant resources) dominate outlying natural deserts.

<p>

  We develop a multiobjective combinatorial optimization model for selecting open space parcels for a system of urban parks/nature reserves. The rapidly growing literature on reserve design models for optimal protection of native species has focused on regional and national scales. Here we develop a model specifically designed for urban-scale nature reserves. The problem is conceptualized as multiobjective in recognition of the multiple and possibly conflicting goals of open space preservation. One objective is to minimize the sum of outer boundary lengths for compactness and connectivity for wildlife corridors. A second objective is to minimize average travel distance from residential zones to open space parcels to promote accessibility. A third objective is to maximize the minimum percent of species habitat contained in nature reserves, over the set of target species. The multiobjective model is solved over a range of budget constraints limiting how many parcels can be included. The optimization model using XpressMP software is linked to a GIS database to form a spatial decision support system. GIS layers include residential populations, existing and candidate open space parcels, and species distributions. The species layers are generated by the GARP model, which is designed to interpolate species density over an entire region based on species survey data at points in space and the underlying environmental gradients such as elevation, slope, aspect, and soil type over the entire region. The model is applied to the rapidly growing northwest section of the Phoenix metropolitan region. Results consist of Pareto-optimal tradeoff curves that quantify the tradeoffs among the various objectives for different budget levels, as well as maps showing open space parcels chosen for particular solutions.

  Variation in landscaping style and maintenance practices associated with different styles may influence a wide range of ecological and social phenomena, including biogeochemical processing, water consumption, avian and insect communities, and quality of life for residents. Experimental tests of these linkages, however, are largely lacking in urban ecology. Using the NDV residential development recently acquired by ASU at its East Campus, we will undertake an unprecedented neighborhood-scale experiment. Four residential landscape design/water delivery types established in blocks of six households each (mini-neighborhoods) will recreate the four prevailing residential yardscape types found across the CAP study area during the first five years of research. These are: mesic/flood irrigation - a mixture of exotic high water-use vegetation and turf grass; oasis - a mixture of drip-watered, high and low water-use plants, and sprinkler-irrigated turf grass; xeric - individually watered, low water-use exotic and native plants; and native - native Sonoran Desert plants and no supplemental water. Six additional households will be monitored as no-plant, no-water controls. Although NDV is not representative of the entire breadth of socioeconomic groups in the CAP region, it is a residential village for students with families. Thus, many of the socioeconomic issues applicable to single-family residences, which comprise the largest component of housing across metro Phoenix, will be addressed.

  A central research question for the NDV experiment is: How does residential landscape design affect socio-ecosystem function at household and neighborhood scales? The experiment will also allow us to examine how biophysical information feeds back into human decision-making and behavior, at the household scale. We will address the following detailed research questions: 1) How do different landscape-treatments influence recreational behavior in yards and common areas? 2) Does structural complexity correlate with quantity of residents ecological folk knowledge? 3) Are people less likely to move into or out of a landscape that conforms to their broader social values? and 4) Do people living in desert landscapes use less water inside and outside their homes?

We aggregated data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the Flood Control District of Maricopa County (FCDMC),  Arizona, USA. The database contains information specific to individual storms monitored at 15 catchments during the period from October 1991 to February 2005. Rain was recorded on 148 days from varying numbers of catchments per day, yielding 394 runoff events (‘‘event’’ refers to runoff from a single catchment during a single storm). Storm attributes, runoff hydrology, and runoff chemistry were separately recorded for each event. The five storm attributes were total precipitation, number of rain-free (dry) days preceding the storm, storm intensity, storm duration, and the season in which the storm occurred. Each catchment is described by six landscape characteristics: contributing area, the proportion of area with impervious land cover, and the proportions of area under residential, commercial, industrial, and undeveloped land use.</p>

<p>
The catchments were selected to span a range of land-use types. Classification was based on aerial photographs and ground truthing by walking each catchment. Portions of a catchment that did not contribute to runoff were not included in contributing area. The channels flowing out of the bases of these urban catchments are made of impervious paving material. These ‘‘streambeds’’ are thus concrete canals and roadway curbsides. This channel structure means that channel features are easily measured (e.g., channel cross sections are simple polygons) and do not erode, shift, or otherwise change substantially over the decadal time scale of this study. Additionally, because they comprise paved material above and at the point of catchment exit, the entire outflow channel of any catchment is a flow-control structure in its own right. The installation of control structures such as V-notch weirs was unnecessary.</p>

<p>
At each catchment, a tipping-bucket rain gage was used to measure precipitation. While runoff efflux was occurring, an instantaneous measurement of discharge (L/s) was made every 60 s. The mean of two consecutive measurements was multiplied by 60 s for an estimate of discharge for each minute. Total runoff was obtained by summing across all minute-specific estimates of discharge.</p>

<p>

  The research has the goal to understand how land-use/land-cover change in the Central Arizona - Phoenix region LTER (CAPLTER) transforms landscape pattern and ecosystem processes at multiple scales.  Using landscape analysis techniques, we will examine urbanization-induced landscape heterogeneity, its dynamics through time, and ecological consequences.  We will investigate changes in ecosystem productivity in response to land-use/land-cover change, and examine the relationship of ecological patterns with the urban heat island and socio-economic drivers of urbanization.  Research findings will facilitate understanding of process-pattern relationships and scaling properties of ecological processes in this region.

</p>
<p>

  The project has three major objectives:

</p>
<p>

  1. 
To characterize the spatial heterogeneity of the Phoenix urban landscape at multiple scales using remote sensing and field data and quantify broad patterns of ecosystem primary production.
  Land cover maps will be produced by synthesizing existing vegetation and land-use/cover maps and using multi-scale, remotely sensed data.  Landsat and ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) data will be used for regional characterization and air photos will be used for fine-scale analysis.  We will quantify the spatial pattern and temporal changes in ecosystem productivity for major land-cover types using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data.  Landscape pattern analysis (LPA) for categorical data and advanced geostatistical techniques will be employed to quantify patterns at progressively changing spatial and thematic resolutions.  LPA metrics will be selected to describe both compositional and configurational aspects of landscape structure (e.g., diversity, fragmentation, connectivity, patch size, and shape complexity).

</p>
<p>

  2. 
To analyze the temporal pattern of land-use and land-cover change and its effects on primary production, and to identify environmental and socio-economic drivers
.  Temporal behavior of compositional and configurational landscape indices from LPA will be analyzed statistically and interpreted in relation to land cover transitions.  Landscape and class level metrics and corresponding grids will be used for correlation and regression analyses with gridded environmental (i.e. topography, elevation, stream density, soil texture, soil moisture) and socio-economic (i.e. population density, median family income, age of development, road density) variables.  Statistical analyses will assess the strength of association between environmental and socio-economic patterns as well as their dependence on scale.  We will conduct a time-series analysis to examine general trends in primary production in three major land uses ?? urban, agricultural, and desert.

</p>
<p>

  3. 
To explore relationships of urban vegetation to urban climate across scales and assess the multiscaled spatiotemporal patterns of the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon
.  Urban vegetation, providing a critical habitat for many wildlife species, has many other benefits including air filtering, climate regulation, rainwater drainage, sewage treatment, noise reduction, and recreational values.  Overall it is capable of reducing certain environmental risks and improving quality of life of urban dwellers.  Thus, we will also investigate urbanization effects on climate in addition to ecosystem productivity.  I will analyze regional patterns of the urban heat island by quantifying heat fluxes and relating them to remotely sensed surface temperature and interpolated air temperature maps.  Local scale dynamics will be investigated using data from existing meteorological stations with known land cover type and water usage along an urban-rural gradient. We expect to gain better understanding of seasonal and diurnal dynamics of the UHI in response to land cover transformations.

"80","Dissolved organic carbon dynamics in an urban desert stream ecosystem","<p>Variation in stream chemistry is a function of the strength of terrestrial-aquatic linkages, the extent to which surface and groundwater exchanges, and the rate of instream biotic processes. The importance of these variables may fluctuate as a function of climate regime, catchment geomorphology, or level of human impact. A mechanistic understanding of the influence of each of these variables on ecosystem functioning will increase understanding of the role of streams in global nutrient and carbon cycles. Of particular interest is dissolved organic carbon (DOC), an important source of carbon and energy for microbial processes. Respiration by heterotrophic bacterial communities has recently been linked to the quality (ability of microbes to utilize C source) of the DOC pool in streams. DOC not only influences stream nutrient supply, but also the transport of contaminants and the attenuation of UV radiation. This dissertation focused on DOC delivery to two arid-land stream ecosystems, one native desert (Sycamore Creek, AZ), and one urban (Phoenix, AZ). The overall objectives of this work were to (1) document patterns in DOC quantity and chemical composition in response to flooding and groundwater exchange, (2) generate and test hypotheses explaining variation in DOC quantity and quality and (3) relate this variation to microbial activity. In the native desert stream ecosystem, the climate regime influenced seasonal variation in the quantity and quality of DOC inputs, with higher complexity and higher concentrations of DOC in summer monsoonal runoff. In contrast, human alteration of geomorphology and hydrologic flowpaths in the Phoenix metropolitan area significantly influenced streamwater chemistry in comparison to low-impact streams in the Sonoran Desert. In the city, mechanisms of nutrient retention and transformation were often shifted from dominance by biotic to abiotic ones, severely dampening the influence of climate regime and substituting instead the maintenance of food production and waste management as the dominant large-scale controlling factors. Patterns of microbial respiration and extracellular enzyme production indicate that the communitys ability to react to changes in DOM composition may create shifts in extracellular enzyme production while maintaining relatively consistent levels of community respiration.

"81","Comparisons between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community in the Phoenix metropolitan area and the surrounding desert","
<p>

  Little is known about the impact of urbanization on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal community structure. A preliminary study in the Phoenix metropolitan area found that AM fungi may be impacted by urban development. Spore densities were found to be lower at urban sites in comparison to desert sites, but it was unclear if the differences observed were due to factors in the urban environment or differences in the plant species growing at urban and desert sites. This study is designed to compare AM fungi from a greater number of urban and desert sites from the Survey 200 project. Soil was collected from exotic and native plants growing at urban sites and from native plants growing at desert sites and used to start pot cultures in the greenhouse to obtain AM fungal spores for identification. The AM fungal community structure of urban and desert sites will be compared.

</p>

","
<p>

  Three soil samples were collected from all survey 200 sites.  Pot cultures have been set up for 100 sites and grown in the greenhouse.  Spores are extracted from pot cultures and identified using microscopic techniques.  Statistical techniques will be used to compare the AM fungal community structure in Phoenix metropolitan urban area and the surrounding Sonoarn desert.

"85","Channel Morphology and Instability along the Urban Fringe","<p>Flood Frequency, and Flood Hazards in the Hassayampa River Region and its Relationship to the Greater Phoenix Area
In order to understand the effects of human modifications to watersheds and main stem channel systems in desert environments, it is necessary to characterize the unmodified system before human activities change it. With progressive urbanization in greater Phoenix, development is expanding beyond the valley onto the piedmonts and the uplands. With this growth comes exposure to channel instability, as well as feedbacks to the channel system by urbanization-driven surface changes. Some of these changes include surficial material changes that change rainfall-runoff relationships, channel engineering, damming and construction of gravel pits in the channel bed. The bulk of the Hassayampa River region, west of Phoenix, has not yet been affected by human modification, but there are several plans for development along the river channel over the next 20 years. In this project, I have investigated how the Hassayampa River channel morphology has changed over time in order to compare it to other channel systems in greater Phoenix that have already been urbanized, and consider how it may change as it urbanizes in the near future. I used aerial photography, flood frequency analyses, public agency reports, and historical documentation including private and newspaper accounts to document lateral changes in channel position caused by lateral erosion and over-bank flooding along the Hassayampa River over time in order to understand flooding frequency, magnitude, and the tendency of these channels to change during varying magnitudes of precipitation events. The results show that in desert environments, any storm of significance will create changes to the fluvial system, but magnitude and frequency of the events are important factors to quantifying hazard. It was also discovered that because most of the Hassayampa River is not yet urbanized, not much historical documentation exists regarding the channel, thus limiting long-term projections of flood frequencies.</p>

"86","Effects of Surface Mulches on Abiotic Processes of Drip-Irrigated Xeric Landscapes","
<p>

  Surface mulches are a common element of urban landscapes, and use of mulches in landscaping is one of the seven principles of Xeriscape.(TM). Landscape surface mulches consist of a wide array of materials, but are generally categorized by their source type as either organic or inorganic. Most municipalities within the CAP LTER area have dust abatement ordinances that require applications of surface mulches like decomposing granite to all bare landscape soil surfaces in public area. Though inorganic mulches are relatively stable and inert, the beneficial ecological impacts of organic mulches on soil and plant processes may be comparatively more significant. Organic mulches are generally less frequently used in the CAP LTER area than inorganic, but the availability of organic mulch materials in increasing. Recycling and reuse of waste products, such as timber logyard residue produced by the logging industry and yard waste produced by the landscaping industry, is important ecologically for reducing landfill volumes. My research utilizes the pre-existing CAP LTER extensive research site at the Desert Botanical Gardens to study the effects of inorganic (decomposing granite) and organic (composted ponderosa pine residue and chipped urban tree trimmings) surface mulches on landscape water and nutrient cycling, productivity, and thermal environments.

"87","Filter Pack Sampler Design for Atmospheric Nitrogen Measurement and Disposition","<p>Atmospheric dry deposition fluxes can be estimated using measurements of atmospheric concentration and estimates of deposition velocity. Filter samplers are commonly used to collect particulate matter but there can be substantial error in measurements of volatile species such as particulate nitrate. Losses due to the temperature dependent dissociation of ammonium nitrate must be quantified to estimate dry deposition fluxes. 
The annular denuder method has been developed to measure gas and particle phase species without bias due to volatilization losses. This method uses a set of coated annular denuders to remove reactive gas species, a Teflon filter to collect particulate species, and a set of back up filters to collect volatilized materials. An annular denuder-filter pack sampler was built and tested to measure ambient concentrations of ammonium nitrate particles and its gas phase precursors. Two sets of samples, PM 10 and PM 1.0 were collected to determine coarse and fine particle concentrations. Samples and method blanks have been analyzed and the results allow for quantitative measurement of gas and particle phase nitrogen species. Dry deposition fluxes calculated using modeled deposition velocities are in agreement with previous estimates.</p>

"89","Biodiversity and Neighborhood Social Variation","<p>Typical indices of urbanization, such as population density, often fail to fully explain patterns of biodiversity in urban areas. For example, neighborhoods with the same human population density can be landscaped with different plants, thereby sustaining different suites of invertebrate and vertebrate species. Human behaviors, values, and resource consumption levels also influence the habitat and food availability in residential areas for birds and other organisms. During CAP-1, we identified a set of small urban parks located in relatively homogeneous neighborhoods varying in socioeconomic status (SES) in the city of Phoenix. This design allowed us to explicitly test the degree to which human socioeconomic and lifestyle factors predict variation in ecological patterns such as bird distribution and abundance. We found a strong correlation between neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and avian diversity in and around parks, independent of variation in the parks themselves. Simultaneous research by other CAP researchers found parallel patterns of covariation between neighborhood SES and a variety of other social and ecological measures including plant diversity and residents' perceptions of their neighborhood amenities. However, these studies were also conducted at different sets of study sites, making it difficult to draw comparisons across studies. This project will establish long-term monitoring of birds at a set of sites sites selected in a similar manner to the parks sites studied in CAP-1 but coincident with Survey200 and PASS sites. This will allow us to simultaneously monitor changes over time in the relationship between biodiversity and neighborhood social variation.</p>

<p>

  This proposed research is part of the long-term project on modeling the ecological responses to environmental changes induced by urbanization in the Phoenix Metropolitan Region.  For the summer of 2005, we propose to conduct a series of simulation experiments using an existing ecosystem process model, PALS-PHX (Patch Arid Land Simulator for Phoenix), to simulate how NPP, biomass, and C/N cycles of Sonoran desert respond to changes in temperature, CO2, and N deposition in the Phoenix region.  This will be a collaborative study, and the collaborators include W. Shen (a former postdoc at LEML, ASU and now in China), N. Grimm, A. Brazel, C. Martin, D. Hope, and C. Gries.  This research is expected to provide insights into possible ecosystem-atmosphere interactions as environmental conditions are altered by urbanization in the Phoenix metropolitan area.  Thus, it will provide needed information for designing and planning future observational and experimental studies in the related research areas.

<b>Introduction</b>



</p>

<p>

  Surface mulches are a common element of urban landscapes, and use of mulches in landscaping is one of the seven principles of XeriscapeTM (http://www.xeriscape.org/fundamentals.html). Most municipalities within the CAP LTER area have dust abatement ordinances that require applications of surface mulches like decomposing granite to all bare landscape soil surfaces in public areas. Though inorganic mulches are relatively stable and inert, the beneficial ecological impacts of organic mulches on soil and plant processes may be comparatively more significant. This purpose of this research is to study the effects of inorganic and organic surface mulches on landscape water and nutrient cycling, productivity, and thermal environments. This summer grant proposal requests monies to support graduate student summer stipend, and material and supplies related to this project.

</p>

<p>

  

<b>Background</b>



</p>

<p>

  Organic mulches are generally less frequently used in the CAP LTER area than inorganic, but the availability of organic mulch materials is increasing. Recycling and reuse of waste products, such as timber logyard residue produced by the logging industry and yard waste produced by the landscaping industry, is important ecologically for reducing landfill volumes. The high organic content of logyard residue restricts its use as a landfill material (Campbell and Tripepi 1992), and stockpiles of logyard residue can cause environmental problems due to spontaneous combustion (Campbell and Tripepi 1992). In 1989, the EPA mandated a 25 percent reduction in landfill disposal by 1995 and a total reduction of 75 percent by the start of the 21st century (Smith et al 1997). Prodigious production of logyard residue from Ponderosa pine timber harvests on the Mogollon Rim of central Arizona and copious generation of yard waste by the landscape industry in the Phoenix metropolitan area pose significant, but often little recognized ecological problems for the CAP LTER region. Recycling of organic residue, as landscape surface mulches may be a viable option for disposal of biomass generated by the landscaping industry.

</p>

<p>

  Data collected on organic and inorganic surface mulches at the Desert Botanical Gardens (DBG) landscape management research facility in the summer 2004 indicate that below ground soil temperatures were more buffered by organic mulches than inorganic or bare soil treatments and that the mulch-soil interface temperatures were lower under organic mulch than inorganic mulches. Inorganic mulch daytime surface temperatures were lower than organic mulch surface temperatures and albedo was higher for the inorganic mulch and bare soil treatments. Nighttime net radiation values were less negative over organic mulches than inorganic mulches. In addition, summertime (August 2004) soil respiration (Rs) CO2 flux was greater for bare soil than soil under mulch in an open, un-shaded location and Rs was greater under mulches in under canopy, shaded locations. Preliminary volumetric water content soil moisture measurements taken this month with a TDR soil moisture probe indicate that after the heavy 2004-2005 winter rains soil is more moist under organic mulches than inorganic. Growth per volume and leaf relative water content (RWC) results for shrubs in each mulch type were more related to previous pruning and irrigation treatment over current mulch treatment. All DBG data collected in 2004 has been provided to the Information Manager in accordance with CAP LTER data policy.

</p>

<p>

  

<b>Research Objective</b>



</p>

<p>

  The objective of the proposed ongoing research is to further determine how inorganic and organic mulches affect ecological processes in a drip irrigated xeric landscape. This research will address the following urban ecological questions:

</p>


<ul>
<li>


    How is the above ground surface energy balance in a xeric landscape affected by inorganic and organic surface mulch type?
  

</li>
<li>


    How are evaporation rates affected by inorganic and organic surface mulches? How does soil moisture differ between mulch types? Can organic mulches be used for water conservation purposes in an arid environment?
  

</li>
<li>


    How does continued mulch usage affect rhizosphere activity such as soil respiration and soil fertility?
  

</li>
<li>


    How does long-term mulch usage affect net primary productivity of newly transplanted, established, exotic and native plant taxa?
  

</li>
</ul>

<b>Project Description</b>



</p>

<p>

  The experimental design for this research project utilizes the pre-existing CAP LTER extensive research site at DBG. Fourteen continuous 30 ft x 30 ft plots (in a 2 x 7 grid) were established in 1998 on a Rillito gravelly, loam soil with 0 to 1 percent slopes. Established plants in each plot include: Nerium oleander (6 per plot), Leucophyllum frutescens (6 per plot), Eucalyptus microtheca (1 per plot), Quercus virginiana (1 per plot) and Opuntia santa-rita (1 per plot). In addition, Encelia farinosa (4 per plot) and Atriplex canescens (2 per plot) were introduced in January 2004.

</p>

<p>

  In April 2004, four mulch ground cover treatments were applied in at a minimum depth of 2 inches (Note, 2 inches is the minimum depth stipulated by the ADOT Landscape and Irrigation Specifications, Section 430.4) to the established plots. The four mulches treatments are:

</p>


<ul>
<li>


    Red Mountain Coral decomposing granite (one quarter inch minus screened), applied to 4 plots
  

</li>
<li>


    Composted ponderosa pine residue (three quarter inch minus screened) applied to 4 plots
  

</li>
<li>


    Chipped urban tree trimmings (approximately three quarter inch unscreened) applied to 4 plots
  

</li>
<li>


    Bare soil (control) 2 plots.

  Project Overview
</h1>

<p>

  Net carbon flows in an urban system are mitigated by human inputs and interactions that control resource inputs and vegetation forms (Figure) and have been shown to have significant effects on productivity of urban vegetation. 

</p>

<p>

  Descriptive research from the first six years of CAP LTER suggests that the principal driver of urban primary productivity is irrigation of landscape vegetation. Productivity of irrigated urban vegetation was estimated to be about 2.8 times higher than that of surrounding Sonoran Desert vegetation. Though the Phoenix urban heat island has a well pronounced atmospheric signature, altered patterns of water cycling caused by differential patterns of irrigation water delivery and the ratio of densities of urban landscape vegetation to the urban impervious surfaces were also shown to have a demonstrable effect on microclimates that were most pronounced in CAP area during early morning hours in summer. Moreover, vegetation management practices such as the frequent trimming of urban vegetation to regulate plant size and form and increase plant canopy density were found to lower plant water use efficiency. Though air in Phoenix is known to be carbon enriched, concentrated impervious surface densities were shown to increase urban heat storage causing elevated above and below ground temperatures and reductions in productivity of urban vegetation by as much as 87%. Research conducted during the first six years of CAP LTER also showed that human landscape preferences in Phoenix are shaped by a desire for the color green, and that the emergent popularity of desert landscape design themes in Phoenix is predominately a top-down social phenomenon directed by public and private interest groups. 

</p>

<p>

   In general, CAP2 research initiatives relative to canopy and under canopy interactions of microclimate and ecosystem processes and net primary productivity need to continue to address and refine our understanding of scaling up from CO2 flux of individual leaves (photosynthesis) to carbon accumulation of whole canopies and communities (productivity). Specifically, research on urban microclimate and NPP during the next six years should address the following three questions:

</p>

<h2>
  Principle research questions:
</h2>

<p>

  1. To what extent are ecosystem/local climate interactions and feedbacks shaped by human response to local climate or other parameters such as water conservation, desert preservation, human preference for green space, architecture and density of impervious urban surfaces? 

</p>

<p>

  2. Urban land use transformations: How will qualitative human perceptions of environmental quality change quantitative patterns of future urban vegetation NPP?

</p>

<p>

  3. What are the cost, benefits, and efficiencies of human inputs (nutrients, water, elevated urban atmospheric CO2, urban heating) and outputs (CO2 respired, evapotranspiration, vegetation removal) to urban vegetation productivity? There is a need to develop a biological context for an analysis of the costs and benefits associated with urban NPP.

Analyzing land use change via a sequence of events permits a view of change only at one geographic location. Analyzing land use change via a transition matrix limits the analysis to two time periods. Nevertheless, many land use databases can now have more detailed classification system over large geographic regions at multiple time periods. We plan to investigate detailed land use change trajectories at selected locations. Locations will be selected from the 200 point survey locations. Our goal is to better understand the transitions that occur in urban environments and what motivates those changes. To do so we plan to construct a spatio-temporal transition classification system that allows for the dynamic exploration of land use change over multiple time periods. The goal is to develop greater insights into the spatial dynamics and temporal sequencing of events, creating multiple models of change during different time periods in the history of the Phoenix SMSA and pointing to possible trends in other cities of the American Southwest and further afield.

</p>

<p>

  This project fits into the land use and land cover change aspects of CAP2. While work by ASU and other scholars has been able to paint broad brushstrokes of human-environment relationships in the Phoenix SMSA this research innovates and adds to current efforts by undertaking detailed, plot level land use and land cover change histories on the 200 point survey locations. The research plans to study both the human mediated land use change and the potential ecological impact of past and current changes, complementing numerous efforts of both IIS, the Center for the Study of Rapidly Urbanizing Regions, and the CAP-LTER. We expect the outcomes to benefit researchers needing to understand the dynamics of urban growth. A further benefit is that the detailed studies will be performed at several of the 200 point survey locations, so researchers using those data will benefit from understanding how the land uses have changed over time. The refined understanding of land use and land cover change in a subset improves our overall understanding of urban ecological dynamics and may point to hidden signals of environmental and social feedback in past transitions.

</p>

<p>

  To undertake this research we will employ a graduate student RA at 50% fte. The RA will hopefully be able to begin research in the summer of 2005 and continue through the academic year 2005-2006.

</p>

<p>

  The specific duties of the RA will be:

</p>


<ol>
<li>


    To help select the locations for the detailed land use change studies from the 200 point sample.
  

</li>
<li>

    To in concert with faculty develop innovative methods for understanding urban environmental histories including the study of remotely sensed images, qualitative methods by interviewing residents, planners, and others, and to build scenarios and narrative models of land use change.
  

</li>
</ol>

  Since the first of February 2005, I have been hosting meetings with a group of individuals at ASU who are interested in remote sensing activities of the CAP-LTER study area. Most of these meetings have been focused on making sure we obtain the necessary images to match up with the 200-point survey that is being conducted this winter and spring as part of the CAP-LTER. In addition, we have been discussing way to enhance the remote sensing activities of CAP. This proposal request funds (1/2 of one month salary; $4,400 + fringe) from CAP-LTER to continue and to expand on these efforts. As mentioned in the CAP-LTER renewal, a vital part of the CAP-LTER project includes using various remote sensing products to examine Land Use and Land Cover (LULC). Three of the main activities associated with the LULCC activities mentioned in the renewal include: 1) classifying, monitoring, and modeling LULCC; 2) examining urban form; and 3) investigating the human drivers of those changes. An Expert Classification System, developed from remotely sensed images (Stefanov et al. 2001), offers a vision of the urban patch structure and its changes over the past decade. Stefanovs classification scheme relied on Thematic Mapper (TM). Unfortunately, the last remaining TM satellite is malfunctioning and no additional replacement is in the foreseeable future. Thus, it is necessary to explore alternative options for land cover classification.

</p>

<p>

  In order to analyze changes in land cover with two images it is important to keep the procedures as identical as possible. I propose to supervise and would like to employ Stefanovs expert system to the new Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) dataset we will be receiving in Spring 2005. ASTER has similar TM spectral and temporal resolution which allows for comparison of some products derived from both sensors. More accurate estimates of vegetation, (both actively photosynthesizing and non-photosynthetic) and impervious cover will enhance the quality of land cover classifications utilizing these data. The largest challenge of adopting this approach is comparing the output of these differing data types both in terms of spatial and spectral resolution. There is no doubt that there will be differences between the dates but separating out differences due to changes in LCLU from sensor differences will be quite challenging. Therefore, reconfiguring the existing classification system to ASTER, which has more bands and finer resolution and interpreting the output is critical. I propose to be heavily involved with these activities.

</p>

<p>

  In addition, during the course of our meetings we have decided to enhance our understanding of the Phoenix CAP-LTER ecosystem by focusing on an urban-to-rural transect at high temporal resolutions. Specifically, we see the need for both day and night time scenes acquired on a monthly basis for at least one annual cycle. Key to this proposal is that these acquired scenes cover the same footprint and include the spectral range of the ASTER instrument (VIS-NIR/SWIR/TIR for daytime and SWIR/TIR for nighttime). Due to the nature of the TERRA platform orbit and the limited pointing capabilities of ASTER, we would expect the nighttime images be spaced at an interval offset appropriately from the collected daytime images (i.e. approximately 8 days). In total we would like to acquire 24 or more scenes. These images will significantly enhance the research of the Urban Heat Island group at ASU and we have been in communication with them in order to coordinate research activities. It is hoped that there would be a year round and diurnal characterization of the citys atmospheresurface interface using remote sensing data supplemented with field-designed measurement sampling methods. In addition, for the first time we will have annual vegetation coverage of the Phoenix area that should supplement many of the ongoing studies within CAP-LTER. I propose this summer to follow-up on a proposal that we are submitting to the ASTER science team to obtain these images. In addition, with my sabbatical at the HarvardForest this Fall and Spring, I will have more time and I plan to work with these images during my sabbatical. This will enhance our characterizations of urban-development trajectories and predictions of urban-center sustainability and resilience. Remote sensing especially ASTER images will play a vital role in this work. Thus it is critical that we obtain these images and more importantly, work up the images such that they are available to the CAP LTER scientists in a useful format.

</p>

<p>

  Finally, CAP-LTER will receive a Quickbird image of Phoenix sometime this Spring. This image will have a spatial resolution of 0.6 m in the panchromatic band and 2.44 meters in the multi-spectral bands. I plan to work with Jason Walker (my graduate student) and Matthias Moeller on using this image to expand on a classification scheme using an object-oriented approach for classifying woody vegetation in an urban environment (Walker and Briggs in review). We will create a more complete land cover classification scheme that is able to extract additional land cover types from this image. If successful, this will significantly expand the capabilities of the LCLU activities in the CAP-LTER.

</p>

<p>

  In summary, this is the first summer that I have requested funds from the CAPLTER program. It is obvious that the projects mentioned above will not be completed during the course of one summer and these projects represent on-going activities that I am involved with. The activities listed in this proposal represent just some of the work that I am currently involved with in the CAP-LTER program. I have listed these projects as I believe that are critical to the LCLU of the CAP-LTER program and these are the CAP-LTER projects that I will be devoting most of my time to.

<p>

  After the expected completion of the installation of the four communiuty landscape treatments at the North Desert Village experiment in May, the research plan of the climate ecosystems interactions IPA is to establish micrometeorological stations, one within each of the four landscape treatments, and to collect measurements of size and summer gas exchange fluxes of the woody trees and shrubs within each treatment design. Actual tasks I will undertake include procurement and assembly of each micrometeorological station's equipment, develop and debug computer programs to run each station, and install each micrometeorological station (including construction of security enclosures) plus link each station to power source supplied by solar charged batteries. Following the protocol of Martin and Stabler (Journal of Arid Environments, 2002) repeated measures of maximum gas exchange fluxes will be made during the month of June. Working in coordination with Corinna Gries, I will also have CAP LTER databases created for these data. During this summer, I will devote an estimated 70% of my time towards these activities.

  Dear Summer Graduate Grant Selection Committee:

   </p>
   <p>
      
  One of the primary objectives of CAP LTER is to understand the structure and functioning of the urban ecosystem (Grimm and Redman 2004, Section 2-1). Being able to analyze ecological patterns within the urbanizing landscape is central to unraveling processes that drive the dynamics of land use and landcover change. A key element to analyzing these patterns is the use of space and aerial imagery in order to classify snapshots of the developing metropolitan area. Grimm and Redman (2004, Section 2-8) suggest a plan of action to improve existing expert-system land cover classification algorithms (Stefanov et al. 2001) and explore new classification approaches such as object-oriented classification (Burnett and Blaschke 2003). I would like the opportunity to tackle the latter portion of this issue. I propose the following projects: (1) testing an existing urban forest classification system that has already been developed for central Arizona (Walker and Briggs, 2005; Walker and Briggs, in review) in a mesic urban ecosystem of Central Europe, Leipzig, Germany, and (2) developing an enhanced high resolution landcover classification system to include additional fundamental landcover types within the classification.

   </p>
   <p>
      
  I am particularly interested in understanding the dynamics of how humans impact vegetation abundance and distribution through urbanization, and what environmental and ecological implications stem from those relationships. In order to analyze these interactions, it is necessary to be able to quantify urban forest structure with a high level of precision (McPherson et al., 1997). Over the past year, a robust object-oriented classification scheme has been developed for woody vegetation mapping with very high resolution (0.6m) color photography for use within the CAP LTER study area (Walker and Briggs, in review). I aspire to create a general classification methodology for demarking urban vegetation that is readily applicable to researchers, landuse planners and policy makers for other urban locations. In order to accomplish a generic classification scheme for urban forest mapping, it is necessary to test this methodology in fundamentally different types of cities.

   </p>
   <p>
      
  Drs. Ellen Banzhaf, past CAP LTER Research Associate, and Dagmar Hasse have invited me to Dept. of Applied Landscape Ecology at Umweltforschungszentrum (UFZ) in Leipzig, Germany in order to analyze the applicability of our existing urban forest classification scheme to the analysis of their city (see appendix C). Leipzig is a sharp contrast to Phoenix. While Phoenix is a young, desert city with a rapidly escalating population driving urban sprawl, Leipzig is a historically mature, significantly more mesic, and shrinking in population and physical size. Leipzig experienced vibrant growth stimulated by government investment from 1870 to 1930, which stagnated and slowly declined until 1989. This marked the onset of post-socialist transformation, in which large numbers of the indigenous population emigrated from the city to find better jobs in other German and international venues. Many residential neighborhoods and commercial buildings abandoned by this urban flight have been torn down as a result of and provide an interesting comparison of ecological and environmental conditions with the LULC dynamics of Phoenix.

   </p>
   <p>
      
  These remarkable differences between these two metropolitans suggest that Leipzig it is a good replicate to test the generic applicability of the existing urban forest classification scheme that was parameterized for a desert city. I propose to travel to Leipzig to collaborate with the abovementioned colleagues in order to test the existing classification scheme by applying it to existing UFZ investigation sites. Additionally, an intensive error analysis will be conducted through analysis of a comprehensive groundtruthing campaign, reflective of the one conducted for the development of the existing classification scheme.

   </p>
   <p>
      
  Secondly, I would like the opportunity to continue the collaborative development of a high-resolution land cover classification of the CAP LTER study area with Thomas Blaschke and Matthias Moeller. Dr. Blaschke visited ASU this spring as part of the URBAN/URS conference hosted by ASU. While here, we began a collaboration with the idea of creating a more complete land cover classification scheme that is capable of distinguishing a variety of additional land cover types found in urban settings. This proposed enhanced object-based classification scheme would seek to adequately discriminate buildings, roads, woody vegetation, grass and other pervious surfaces. A rough draft of this classification system was established during our initial meetings. However, this classification scheme needs additional classification discrimination analysis and parameterization in order to address some of the existing obvious misclassifications (fig. 1). We propose to work on this aspect of this project this summer.

   </p>
   <p>
      
  Figure 1. Beta version of enhanced landcover classification system. Top image is raw high resolution imagery; bottom image is an output of the classification system with the classes: buildings (red), bare soil/gravel (tan), pools (aqua), roads and parking lots (grey), grass (light green), and woody vegetation (dark green). Obvious existing misclassifications include confusing: roads and buildings, grass and bare soil, and buildings and bare soil. I propose to investigate additional class discrimination analysis and parameterization in order to minimize these errors as part of this grant, and to conduct thorough error analysis of the final classification scheme.

   </p>
   <p>
      
  Once the visual classification is satisfactory, I propose a rigorous error analysis with an in situ groundtruthing reference database that I collected in Fall 2004 (Walker and Briggs, in review). This error analysis will indicate what the limitations and error associated with classification process. With a well-documented classification scheme and error analysis, the output of this sub-project will produce a product that is appropriate for analyzing spatial relationships among landcover types at a very fine scale. This process will assist in the development of dynamic models that analyze the causes and mechanisms spurring landcover change in order to decompose the drivers of urban change.

   </p>
   <p>
      
  The products from this proposal are twofold, yet continuous. A generic urban forest classification scheme will be useful to researchers in most urban settings interested in fine scale ecological relationships. The development of an enhanced land cover classification scheme will be broadly useful to those in the CAP LTER community interested in fine scale phenomena and will be made publicly available to that community.

  Project Description

</p>

<p>

  As centers of population and industry, cities have elevated concentrations of heavy metals in soils and receiving waters. Studies have found elevated levels of iron, arsenic, lead, zinc, copper, nickel, and cadmium in storm runoff and soils (Pouyat and McDonnell 1991; Fossum et al. 2001). The presence of these metals represents a potential threat to both ecosystem and public health. High doses may be toxic to biota, and chronic low doses may be biomagnified in higher trophic levels. The metals may also infiltrate into groundwater, contaminating public drinking water sources, resulting in high treatment costs. However, many metals are intercepted by adsorption to clays, humus, and minerals under certain conditions. Thus, some soils and aquatic sediments may provide an ecosystem service by trapping metals, preventing their movement into groundwater or incorporation into biomass.

</p>

<p>

  Terrestrial and aquatic components of urban landscapes also experience substantial nitrogen (N) loading via deliberate import, fossil fuel combustion, and introduction of N-fixing legumes. Heavy N loading can result in eutrophication of receiving waters, a change in nutrient limitation status for vegetation, loss of biodiversity and, if present in high quantities in drinking water, a public health threat. Export of N from ecosystems represents only a portion of this large input (Boyer et al. 2002), with remaining N either accumulating or being lost via unmeasured pathways. The relative importance of the three major mechanisms for N retention or removal, biological uptake, soil storage, and denitrification is unknown for many ecosystems. Denitrification is a microbial process that converts nitrate (NO3-) into N2 or N2O gases, and thus removes N from the ecosystem. This process only occurs in anoxic conditions when oxygen is no longer available as an electron acceptor, and can be limited either by NO3- (the alternate electron acceptor) or by quantity or quality of the organic carbon supply to heterotrophic denitrifiers. Studies have shown that additions of NO3- have stimulated denitrification, while addition of organic carbon (oC) in other cases has a much greater effect (Schlesinger 1991). Locations in the landscape that furnish the requisite conditions for denitrification provide an important ecosystem service by ameliorating the effects of elevated N loading.

</p>

<p>

  It is probable that landscape position determines heavy-metal loading and retention. For example, proximity to hazardous waste generation sites or applications of pesticides and herbicides could increase heavy metal concentrations locally. During storms, water mobilizes and transports particles with adsorbed metals, organic compounds, and N species that have accumulated on the surfaces. This metal and nutrient-laden water is often delivered to retention basins, which are designed to facilitate the ecosystem service of stormwater mitigation. These particle-associated contaminants may accumulate in upper soil layers. Datry et al. (2003) found that, although sediments in a retention basin in France had elevated concentrations, heavy metals were rarely detected in porewater moving through the soil column to the groundwater table. Heavy metal interception is likely to be controlled by clay and humus content of soils and sediments, but changes in redox state may solubilize some metals, resulting in leaching.

</p>

<p>

  There are several reasons to expect denitrification rates also to vary with to land cover and position. Landscape locations differentially receive requisite substrates, NO3- and oC and vary temporally in the likely prevalence of anoxia. For example, Kaye et al. (2004) found that urban lawns emitted 10 times as much N2O to the atmosphere than native grasslands in Colorado. These lawns, heavily watered and frequently fertilized, provide adequate quantities of NO3- and oC to bacteria, and therefore may be hot spots for denitrification, but only during hot moments (McCain et al. 2003) when anoxic conditions are produced by irrigation. My own preliminary research on lakes in the Phoenix area (unpublished data) has shown that sediments had high denitrification potentials, but whether or not in situ rates are as high remains to be seen. High rates of denitrification in lake sediments are likely limited by the rate of NO3- diffusion from the overlying surface water. In retention basins, Zhu et al. (2004) demonstrated that green (turf-dominated) basins had some of the highest potential denitrification rates reported in the literature.

</p>

<p>

  Metropolitan Phoenix represents an ideal location for field investigation of nitrogen and metal loadings and interactions. Estimated areal N inputs to the Central Arizona-Phoenix (CAP) ecosystem are an order of magnitude higher than those to the surrounding desert, are overwhelmingly human-mediated, and exceed outputs (17 - 20% of N inputs are accumulated) (Baker et al. 2001). Because of historically weak environmental regulation coupled with rapid, poorly planned growth, the area has &gt;650 hazardous waste sites (Bolin et al. 2002). Fossil-fuel combustion from mobile sources also increases heavy metal deposition. Thus, it is likely that Phoenix has high point- and non-point-source pollution levels for N and heavy metals. Storm runoff in the area has been characterized as replete with NO3- and organic compounds (Hope et al. 2004). Across the Phoenix valley there is a gradient of NOx deposition that may produce a similar gradient of NO3- loading to retention basins and lakes. Known variation in heavy metal deposition (Zschau et al. 2003) depends on proximity to point sources such as hazardous waste generation sites, or to non-point sources such as roadways.

</p>

<p>

  Currently, CAP is in the process of re-sampling the Survey 200 sites located throughout the LTER. In addition to the usual analyses of nutrient content and soil characterization, this round will be augmented by the addition of metal analyses. However, the current CAP categories of land use do not include two potential hot spot land use types for metal and nutrient interception: retention basins and lakes. I propose to collect lake and retention basin soil samples, using the same protocol employed by CAP technicians, and analyze them for the same parameters. This project will therefore expand the Survey 200 sample size and enhance the comparative value of the results. My research will enhance prior and ongoing biogeochemical research focused on both pristine desert and urban ecosystem functioning. Previous and current CAP work on metals includes surveying and monitoring soil, stormwater, and canal water concentrations, but little is known about the dynamics of these metals, or the ecosystem services potentially provided by recipient systems. I will of course make all data available to CAP LTER researchers. Additionally I work with them to determine the best method to incorporate my sites with the original sample design.

</p>

<p>

  With funding from the CAP LTER, I would be able to conduct metal analyses on water, sediment and soil samples from 16 locations: 8 lakes and 8 retention basins. For each lake I will collect and analyze both water and sediment samples. Because so little is known about which metals are ecologically and economically important, I will use an Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICPMS), which can analyze samples for the whole periodic table. Some of the products I envision from this research are maps of the CAP LTER for several elements of ecological, economic and/or public health importance. Such an analysis would probably require a kriging method for interpolating values between sample locations. In addition to increasing the sample size of the Survey 200, my sample locations would be selected to utilize the data from Survey 200 sites to characterize possible regional patterns in metal distribution throughout the CAP LTER. Furthermore, this project of identifying these patterns in an urban environment is but a small part of the plans for my dissertation research. In the future, I plan on expanding this inquiry to investigate possible nutrient-metal interactions and the economic value of services provided by ecosystem services. But some basic descriptive data of existing concentrations is a necessary first step for creating an intelligent study design.

Although the manuscripts was rejected, the reviewers had very constructive criticism and encouraged revision and resubmission.

</p>

<p>

  Work with Sean Whitcomb to redo data analysis of a study conducted at the DBG Experimental Landscape Plot on the effects of pruning on mycorrhizal colonization. This data will then be used as part of manuscript in preparation that I plan to submit this year with Chris Martin.

  NPP Monitoring Plots

</p>

<p>

  Start field monitoring of plant disease sand stresses at the NPP monitoring sites. I plan to accompany the RA who will be collecting data at these sites this summer. This project is a new project that I will be continuing during my sabbatical leave in the Spring semester 2006. This summer, I need to develop my sampling method, assessment protocol and start collecting digital images for the database of disease and stress problems that I will be developing with Corinna Gries.

"111","Water chemistry of lakes and rivers following winter storm events","
<p>

  The everlasting need to supply immense quantities of potable water to the millions of humans inhabiting the PhoenixDesertBasin has resulted in a vast number of managed water systems, both canals and rivers, established throughout the state of Arizona. There is significant effort built into maintaining the quality of water in the area for drinking and for the co-existence of plants and animals in the desert. Understanding the biogeochemical processes affecting element and nutrient transport along the managed river systems is a vital component to assuring quality water continues. Concerns about water quality are reflected in plans to study fluxes of nutrients and toxins in the CAP2 renewal proposal, which includes a specific plan to determine spatial and temporal distributions of contaminants in surface water and soils. The research proposed here is complementary to efforts underway in the CAP-LTER project.

</p>

<p>

  The CAP-LTER approach to studying nutrient and toxin fluxes in surface waters is to collect spatially distributed samples at the same time (Verde River, Salt River, CAPCanal, 91st Ave. Treatment Plant, Gila River). An alternate approach is to study water chemistry at one location as water moves through the system over a set time interval. This approach is facilitated by the large storm events beginning in December of 2004 that provide flowing water through the CAP-LTER study area. I have been sampling water daily on the Salt River at TempeTownLake since January 5 2005. I propose to use these samples together with additional Verde and Salt River samples to answer three fundamental questions:

</p>


<ol>
<li>


    How does the recent rain affect element transport within rivers in arid regions, including those that are often dry?
  

</li>
<li>


    How are management practices (human ecosystem interaction) reflected in the changing chemical composition of these rivers?
  

</li>
<li>


    Are there unique anthropogenic signals (trace elements), indicative of an urban ecosystem, present in the water as it moves through the study area?
  

</li>
</ol>


<p>

  The PhoenixBasin is comprised of several arid climate rivers that rarely receive high flow. A large quantity of rain fell throughout much of Central Arizona, including Phoenix and the surrounding area, beginning in late December through February in a series of anomalous events. The resulting hydrograph of the Salt River at the Priest Drive gauging station is shown in Figure 1. The data show several high flow events occurring from December 2004 to March 2005. Inflatable dams constructed to form what is now Tempe Town Lake from the Salt River were removed following the large storms, and water was allowed to flow freely for the first time in many years producing nearly natural flow in the Salt River. The normally managed watershed metamorphosed into a natural river system with potential chemical inputs from surrounding natural surfaces such as soils and human built surfaces such as freeways. The purpose of this study is to take advantage of renewed flow on the Salt River to study fluxes of these chemical inputs.

</p>

<p>

  I have selected a sample site located along the Salt River at Tempe Town Lake between Mill Ave. and Rural Road for daily sample collection (sample collection continues to present). Additional sample locations have been added to compliment temporal data with spatial information. These include samples taken weekly along the Verde and Salt Rivers upstream of both Granite Reef Dam and the confluence, downstream of Tempe Town Lake along the Salt River at 40st street, and the lower and upper Salt River with its many reservoirs and tributaries on a monthly basis.

</p>

<p>

  A suite of information is gathered at all sample locations that includes: pH, conductivity, temperature, alkalinity, and turbidity. Water samples are collected for major solutes (by ion chromatography, IC) and trace elements (by High Resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry, HR-ICP-MS) and stable isotope analysis. Bottles for IC analysis are rinsed in triplicate with NanoPure deionized (DI) water then soaked for a minimum of 24 hours before use. In the field, IC sample bottles are rinsed once with filtered sample then filled with 30mL of filtered sample. A 0.2/0.8 micron syringe filter is used with a 2 micron glass membrane pre-filter. Samples are analyzed by ion chromatography with help from Natasha Zolotova in Everett Shocks lab. Bottles for ICP analysis are soaked in 10% nitric acid for a minimum of 24 hours, then rinsed with NanoPure DI water in triplicate and dried. The bottles are spiked with 200 micro-liters of trace metal free nitric acid to ensure no precipitation of solids. The same filtering technique is used to collect 30mL of sample. No pre-rinse is required as the bottles are cleaned in the lab and the final concentration of acid is predetermined. Dr. Panjai Praipong will assist me in running samples on the High Resolution ICP-MS in Dr. Everett Shocks lab.

</p>

<p>

  Analysis of preliminary data reveals that variations in major element chemistry correlate with high discharge events along the river system, whether natural or human induced. As shown in Figure 2a chloride, sulfate and sodium concentrations generally decrease from early January to early February, and exhibit synchronous variations. A dampening effect of peak amplitude is evident in the sulfate data, and all three solutes approach similar concentrations (in ppm) by the end of the time period shown. Magnesium concentrations (Fig. 2b) show an overall decline in concentration with peaks that are synchronous with those in Figure 2a. In contrast, concentrations of calcium increase over time. Concentrations of the nutrients nitrate and potassium are shown in Figure 2c where it can be seen that K+ behaves similarly to Na+, Cl-, SO4-2 and Mg+2. In contrast, nitrate concentrations increase initially and then fluctuate slightly around 2ppm. Note the decline in most solute concentrations between January 5th and 13th corresponding to an increase in nitrate concentrations.

</p>

<p>

  Although I am at a very early stage in this study, some fundamental differences in solute transport are all ready evident. It appears that the processes influencing calcium and nitrate concentrations differ from those that control most of the other solutes. In addition, the processes affecting calcium and nitrate differ to some extent, because calcium concentrations continue to increase as nitrate concentrations become nearly constant. It may be that calcium concentrations are strongly affected by pH change through carbonate equilibrium. Nitrate concentrations may be influenced by application of fertilizers or other human induced changes. Analyzing the rest of the major solute samples, and expanding this study to include trace elements will allow me to test these and other ideas about the controls on fluxes of chemical constituents in the Salt River system.

</p>

<p>

  Upon completion of this data set, including the spatial distribution, conclusions can be drawn about element transport in the natural and human influenced surface water environment. At times this transport may be like that of unmanaged rivers, but at other times it is likely to be driven by human management decisions. As described above, three distinct behavioral regimes are evident in the current major element chemistry (Figure 2). Each of these signatures may correspond to different water-soil/rock interactions or human interactions within the watershed and/or CAP-LTER study area. It will be interesting to see if trace element data support these three regimes or provide additional complexities. The suite of trace metals that will be analyzed includes, but is not limited to Fe, Cd, Sr, Li, B, Be, Al, Pb, P, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, and Rare Earth Elements. Resolution of chemical behaviors using a large data set may allow me to identify source fingerprints thereby identifying possible anthropogenic, water management and natural inputs to the Salt River. Identifying the source of water during discharge events and correlating that information with known chemical fluxes of metals and nutrients during those times will establish a chemical fingerprint of different water-soil/rock interactions.

"113","Effects of River Modification on the Soil Seed Bank of the Salt River, Arizona: a case study of an arid region river","<p>Riparian ecosystems have been degraded in the southwestern US as demand for water has increased and driven the construction of dams and water diversion projects.  The Salt River in Arizona is no exception.  This once large perennial river has been reduced to a small ephemeral channel in places.  Other reaches within the large urban center of Phoenix flow intermittently because storm drains provide runoff from urban sources. No research had been conducted to determine the effects of flow regime alteration and watershed urbanization on the Salt River riparian plant community much less on the soil seed bank.  Studies on other Sonoran Desert rivers show that a large percentage of the riparian flora are seed-banking species, and that remnant floras may persist in the seed banks of below-dam reaches. Using the seedling emergence method, we conducted a seed bank study of three dam-influenced reaches of the Salt River, and also sampled extant vegetation. We expected richness of the seed bank and extant vegetation to be higher in the perennial reach upstream of Phoenix than in the ephemeral and intermittent urban reaches, and we expected to find higher similarity between vegetation and seed bank in this more frequently flooded reach, as well.  However, our results showed species richness of seed bank and extant vegetation to be high in the urban reach that flows in response to storm drain runoff.  These results reveal the functional role of constructed urban tributaries in restoring riparian plant species diversity to dewatered reaches.</p>",NULL,NULL
"114","Growth effects on Encelia farinosa (brittlebush) due to suppression of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi at an urban and a desert site.","
<p>

  Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are obligate symbionts that are found in roughly 75% of the terrestrial plants around the world (Smith and Read, 1997). Research supporting the importance of the association between these ubiquitous fungi and their hosts at a variety of agricultural and natural systems continues to grow. A majority of this research has focused on the reciprocal exchange of nutrients between host plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (Rillig, 2004). Plants receive growth-limiting phosphorus from the fungus in exchange for photosynthates that they supply to the fungus (Read and Moreno, 2003). AM fungi also appear to have a role in drought tolerance in plants (Auge, 2004), the control of some soil and root pathogens (Newsham et al., 1994; Smith and Read, 1997), and improve the reproductive output as compared to non mycorrhizal plants (Janos, 1980; Koide, 1991). Economically important agricultural crops were among the first groups of plants examined to identify a role for AM fungi in improving plant productivity (Mosse, 1977), but AMF have recently been shown to have a pivotal role in plant community ecology by altering plant productivity and diversity (Klironomos et al., 2000).

</p>
<p>

  This project compares the functional aspects of arbuscular mycorrhiza in the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area and the surrounding Sonoran desert by examining the productivity of Encelia farinosa (brittlebush) at urban and desert sites when AM fungal colonization is suppressed. The information on mycorrhizal functioning and its impact on plant productivity in urban desert areas is limited. An AM fungal inoculation study by Martin and Stutz (1994) found that the affect of AM fungi on plant growth depended not only on the AM fungal and plant species, but also on the abiotic conditions that the plant is growing in. Stabler et al (2001) found that there was less root colonization in the residential sites in comparison to trees growing in an adjacent urban park. What is currently unknown is the impact of AM fungi on net primary productivity in urban areas.

</p>
<p>

  This study will investigate the effect of AM fungal colonization on the growth and fitness of brittlebush growing at an urban site and at a desert site. Brittlebush is a native, desert plant commonly found in the Sonoran desert surrounding Phoenix and used as an ornamental plant in residential and commercial sites in the Phoenix metropolitan area. Because this plant is common in urban and desert areas, it can be used to compare AM fungal colonization levels between these areas. Levels of AM fungal colonization can be manipulated by using the fungicide Benomyl (methyl-1-(butyl-carbamoyl)-2-benzimidazole) which has been shown to suppress colonization of roots by AM fungi with little phytotoxicity or effect on soil nutrients (Fitter and Nichols, 1988; Hartnett and Wilson 2002). Hartnett and Wilson (2002) state that the best method available to assess the roles and functions of AM fungi in natural communities is through the use of fungicides; and to that end benomyl has been used quite successfully. Treatment with benomyl will allow for comparisons between plants that have typical levels of mycorrhizal colonization and those with low suppressed levels of colonization. My research questions for the project include:

</p>

<ol>
<li>


    Does treatment with benomyl impact the growth of brittlebush and does this impact differ in plants growing in the desert versus urban areas?
  

</li>
<li>


    Are there differences in mycorrhizal fine root colonization of brittlebush in urban and desert locations?
  

</li>
</ol>

<p>

  Site Description

</p>
<p>

  Data will be collected from plants growing at 2 CAP-LTER long term experimental projects (Grimm et al., 2000). The first study site, designated as urban, is located at the CAP-LTER experimental plots located at the Desert Botanical Garden (DBG) in Phoenix, Arizona, USA (N 33deg. 27.897 W 111deg. 56.397, elevation 1261 feet). All plants at this site were transplanted into simulated landscapes. The second study site, designated as desert, is located at the CAP-LTER experimental plots located at Usery Mountain Park (UMP), Mesa, Arizona (N 33deg. 28.704 W 111deg. 36.909, elevation 2018 feet). All plants at this site were naturally growing in the area. Twenty-eight brittlebush plants growing at each site were selected in this study.

</p>
<p>

  

</p>
<p>

  Benomyl Treatment

</p>
<p>

  A benomyl drench consisting of a solution of .24 grams of benomyl/Liter of water was applied to half of the plants at each site as described by Dhillion and Gardsjord (2004). Commencing in July 2004, each benomyl treatment plant received two liters of solution every five weeks.

</p>
<p>

  Plant Response and Measurements

</p>
<p>

  Six months after the beginning of benomyl application, plants were cut back to a uniform volume not exceed 80 cm3. Plant height and width measurement data were collected. Several measurements of plant productivity will be taken at the end of the spring growing season. Measurements of height and width will be used to calculate biovolume. Random leaves will be collected from intersection points formed from an imaginary 3x3 grid placed over the top of the plant, with one additional leaf collected from the center of the plant and placed in self-locking plastic bags. Leaf area measurements of the collected leaves will be made using a CID inc. CI-203 Laser Area Meter with conveyor attachment (Vancouver, Washington, USA). The number of flower clusters and seed heads will be collected, counted, dried, and weighed when present to calculate reproductive effort (Koide 1991). Plants will then be clipped back to their February 6, 2005 volume. The removed plant tissue from each plant will be bagged, dried and weighed to determine biomass accumulation during the growing season.

</p>
<p>

  Determination of Root Colonization

</p>
<p>

  Roots were collected for analysis of colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) prior to Benomyl application in the summer of 2004 and eight months after benomyl application began (April of 2005). Soil and root samples collected from beneath the canopy of each plant to a depth of 15-20 cm and roots were fixed in 50% ethanol, cleared of cytoplasm and stained with trypan blue (Koske and Gemma, 1989). Percent colonization by arbuscular mycorrhiza will be ascertained using modified intercept method (McGonigle et al, 1990).

</p>
<p>

  Statistical Analysis

</p>
<p>

  A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to test for significant effects between site (urban and desert) and fungicide treatment (benomyl) and AM fungal colonization, plant biomass, volume, height, leaf area, number of flowers and seed biomass. Tukeys HSD will be used to test comparisons of means when appropriate. Simple linear regression analysis will be utilized to test for correlation between AM fungal colonization and plant biomass, seed biomass, leaf area, and volume. Data will be assessed to test the assumptions of linearity, independence, normality and equal variance for the use of parametric statistical tools and transformed if necessary. Data will be analyzed in SYSTAT.

"115","Patterns of Trace Element Distribution in an Urban Desert System","
   <p>
      
  Introduction

   </p>
   <p>
      
  An urban ecological system differs from other ecological systems in that it is dominated by the activity of humans. Studying the processes and patterns of an ecological system that integrates both social and ecological variables requires careful constraint of complex models, especially in the case of fluxes of materials in an urban desert system. Material fluxes are critical links between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem components. These fluxes include nutrients such as C, N and P, as well as other elements such as heavy metals, and other toxic and nontoxic trace elements. Recently, the expansion of urban areas has led to large changes in human mediated inputs of trace elements, both intentional and inadvertent, that are introduced and dissipated into the environment. Following the movement of trace elements is becoming an increasingly important method to understand the ecosystem effects of these environmental hazards, and the resilience of the environment to anthropogenic inputs. Soil is the largest recipient system of toxic and nontoxic trace elements in most terrestrial ecosystems, and is also the foundation of all plant, animal, and human activities. Investigating the spatial distribution of trace elements in soils can reveal human influences on terrestrial ecological systems, and may influence other aspects of urban ecology as well as decision making. Therefore, a study of the spatial and temporal distribution of trace elemental contaminants in soil is proposed that builds on the Central Arizona Phoenix Long Term Ecological Research project at ASU.

   </p>
   <p>
      
  Perspective

   </p>
   <p>
      
  It is generally known that Mn, Fe, and Mg are essential to biological growth and development. However, excessive exposure to these nontoxic trace elements may change life patterns of plants and microorganisms. Several other trace elements, such as As, Cr, Hg, Pb and Cd are rather toxic even in very small amounts. Plants may absorb these trace elements from contaminated soil, which may result in damage to the plant systems or DNA, or may in turn harm the health of humans and animals that depend upon these plants as food. Recently, it was shown that there are significant correlations between trace elements concentrations1,2, such as Cr, As, Mn, with Al, Cd with Sb, and Ni, Mo, As with Fe. In addition, there are possible relations between cycles of major nutrients such as carbon3 and nitrogen4 with trace elements accumulation and release. Also, organic carbon in soil can absorb trace elements and become a natural sink, and ground water may be contaminated during infiltration of water from the surface soil, carrying trace elements with it.

   </p>

   </p>
   <p>
      
  Project Description

   </p>
   <p>
      
  Phoenix is one of the fastest developing cities in North America, and is located in a broad, alluvial basin surrounded by vast acreage of deserts. Almost all of its growth and expansion has occurred in the second half of the twentieth century. Such fast regional growth has brought prosperity as well as environmental problems associated with resource demand and pollution. Toxins and pollutants may concentrate in recipient systems (soil, surface and ground water, atmosphere), and the distribution of these naturally occurring or anthropogenically generated trace elements and nutrients may lead to fundamental shifts in biogeochemical cycling.

   </p>
   <p>
      
  There are two main sources of trace elements in soils: 1) weathering and erosion of bedrock; and 2) human activities including agriculture, mining, smelting, industry and transportation. The unique geological setting of Arizona, with past volcanic activities and million of years of erosion, leads to natural abundances of trace elements in desert sediments. At the same time, Phoenix, a rapidly expanding city with its constructions and urbanization, is a huge source of human generated trace elements, and this makes the distribution of trace elements more complicated.

   </p>
   <p>
      
  The spatial distribution of various trace elements in soil can be mapped by analyzing samples collected from locations randomly distributed across the whole Phoenix region. The soil sample sites are all based on the CAP LTER 2005 200 point survey, and the land use type of these survey sites varies from agricultural land to open desert, from residential areas to industrial areas, and from highways to canals. By the end of May 2005, 400 soil samples from 200 survey spots will be obtained by the survey crew, one top soil and one deeper soil sample for each spot. The top soil is soil from the surface to a depth of 10 cm, and the deeper soil comes from the 10 to 30 cm interval. In cases where the soil corer cannot reach a depth of 30 cm before it hits bedrock, the sample is collected from the deepest depth possible.

   </p>
   <p>
      
   </p>
   <p>
      
  Methods

   </p>
   <p>
      
  Soil samples are collected by the LTER survey crew following the LTER protocol. In order to avoid any contamination of trace elements, soil samples are transferred by plastic spatulas (10% nitric acid soaked for at least 24 hr between each usage) and stored in plastic bottles (10% nitric acid soaked for at least 24 hr), weighed, oven dried for 48 hr at 60oC and stored at room temperature. Before analysis, soil samples are sieved through a 2mm plastic sieve (washed in deionized (DI) water, 10% nitric acid and acetone wiped between usages) and ground with an agate mortar and pestle (acetone wiped between usages).

   </p>
   <p>
      
  Elemental analysis and sample preparation will be carried out using the High Resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP MS, Finnigan Element II) in Prof. Everett Shock s clean lab. Sample preparation and ICP MS analysis will be done under the direct supervision of Dr. Panjai Prapaipong. ICP MS analysis permits very low detection limits for trace elements in soil samples. As examples, preliminary results show that detection limits for Pb, Cr, Cd, and As are 0.0095, 0.0024, 0.0046, and 0.0140 ppb, respectively. I will select a suite of samples based on variations of land use type and analyze both top soil and deeper soil from each location.

   </p>
   <p>
      
  Mixtures of HNO3, HCl and HF are widely used as reagents for soil sample digestions5,6. Although HCl can cause interferences in ICP analysis, use of a small amount can stabilize elements such as Ag, Sb, Ba, and high concentrations of Fe, Al. HF can dissolve particles and sand that consist of quartz and other silicates, however, as it is a very toxic reagent, its usage should also be controlled. I will add 10ml HNO3, 1.5ml HCl and 0.5ml HF to each sample, and the samples will be microwave digested using EPA standard method 30527.

   </p>
   <p>
      
  In order to limit and quantify any contamination in our analytical procedures, clean quartz sand will be sieved and ground as a blank to test the analytical methods. Vessels, flasks and sieves are soaked in 10% nitric acid for 3 days after each usage, and washed with DI water and dried. Teflon beakers are first soaked with 35% nitric acid for 3 days, 10% nitric acid for 3 days and then washed with DI and dried.

   </p>
   <p>
      
  The results will be plotted on a regional map, which will help to identify trends and patterns in various trace element concentrations, correlations with land use types, and depth variations. The results will guide additional efforts after this summer to generate maps and diagrams showing the spatial distribution of various elements, which will provide a strong quantitative basis for studies of the fluxes of trace elements in the urban ecosystem.

   </p>
   <p>
      
   </p>
   <p>
      
  Preliminary Results

   </p>
   <p>
      
  I used 10 soil samples of various land use types from the 2000 CAP LTER 200 point survey to test the methods described above. Although the samples are all collected five years ago, and element content may have changed during storage, I discovered that the concentrations vary among samples, and that heavy metals such as Pb, Cu, Zn and other trace elements such as Cr and As tend to be more abundant in soils from industrial areas, major roads and highways. Surprisingly, the soil sample from a residential area shows relatively high contents of Pb and Zn. The agricultural soil sample has the highest concentration of Cr out of the 10 samples selected. Once I collect data on many samples, I can test whether the high concentrations of particular elements in areas other than industrial and transportation areas are general phenomena or just exceptional results for individual samples. With our clean sample preparation methods and high resolution ICP MS analysis, the new 2005 samples can surely provide more accurate and inspiring data.

   </p>
   <p>
      
  Ranges of trace element content (ppm) from the ten 2000 CAP LTER soil samples:

   </p>
   <p>
      
   V 52 to 95 Cr 17 to 71 As 2 to 33 Pb 12 to 76 Ni 10 to 39 Cu 15 to 55 Zn 42 to 182       

   </p>
   <p>
      
  Time table

   </p>
   <p>
      
  The project will be accomplished over a three month period from middle May to middle August. Approximately two thirds of my time will be spent on sample preparation and analysis by ICP MS, with the goal of analyzing 200 soil samples (two each from 100 locations). The rest of my time will be spent on analyzing and interpreting the results and mapping trace element distributions. I am willing to provide my data to the information manager.

"116","RA fall 2005 biodiversity Bills","
<p>

  During Fall 2005, Rob would be working on two on-going LTER projects, Survey 200 and North Desert Village (NDV) dealing with the biodiversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi.

</p>

<p>

  Specific duties of the RA.

</p>

<p>

  1) Rob will be isolating and identifying spores from 20 sites that remain from the first Survey 200. Cultures from these sites are in refrigerated storage. This project was not completed during AY 2004-2005 because Robs RA assignment was split with Climate/Ecosystem Dynamics IPA. Assessing diversity at these sites is important because they are either part of bird and/or arthropod diversity studies or are sites were vegetative measurements are being taken for Primary Productivity.

</p>

<p>

  2) Rob will be setting up and growing pot cultures of AM fungi from soil collected in Spring 2005 during the second Survey 200. Five soil samples were collected from Survey 200 sites during the Spring 2005 for the assessment of AM fungi diversity. Because of delays in greenhouse construction at ASU East, we will not be able to immediately set up cultures in the greenhouse until mid-summer to early fall. Starting and growing pot cultures is the first necessary step required to identify spores to assess biodiversity at Survey 200 sites.

</p>

<p>

  2) Rob will be staining roots and assessing colonization by AM, ectomycorrhizal and dark-staining endophte (DSE) fungi in roots collected as part of the pre-treatment baseline survey at the NDV Experimental Survey. He will also enter this data into the NDV database. This project was not done during the 2004-2005 AY because Rob had to split his time between Biodiversity projects and NPP Projects (see below).

</p>

<p>

  Name and qualifications of the RA. Rob has been doing these activities during the past 2 years as a CAP LTER RA. I have attached a CV to this document. He is well versed in the culture and identification of AM fungi. He will be completing his M.S. thesis during the Fall 2005 but this new data will not be in his thesis but will be useful for future publications.

  Description of the project. Our project is titled Monitoring Human Environment Interactions in a Controlled Landscaping Experiment. This project is the social science component of CAP LTERs landscaping experiment at North Desert Village (NDV) on the ASU East Campus. Initial funding for this project was provided by a pilot grant from the College of Liberal Arts (project investigators are Scott Yabiku, Patricia Gober, David Casagrande, Charles Redman, Nancy Grimm, Elizabeth Wentz, and Sharon Harlan). The aim of this project is to study the reciprocal relationships between humans and their immediate residential environment.

</p>

<p>

  With Elizabeths outstanding efforts and initiative, we have finished two pre treatment data collections: 1) non invasive observations of activities at NDV and 2) in person survey interviews in residents homes. The non invasive observations, which did not involve contact with the residents, recorded what activities people performed in their yards and common spaces at different times (gardening, playing with children, exercising, eating, and other activities). The survey interviews collected information about residents social networks and their environmental satisfaction, knowledge, and practices. Currently, the NDV neighborhood blocks are being manipulated, and they have been assigned different landscaping treatments: mesic, xeric, oasis, native, and control (decomposing granite). In AY 2005 2006, the social science survey will be repeated after the landscape manipulation is complete to determine how the experimental treatment affected residents. This post treatment interview is important for the human measurement team at NDV because it will allow us to measure the impact of the experimental manipulation.

</p>

<p>

  The post treatment interview is also very important for the overall CAP2 goals because it may be one of the few studies to successfully observe human changes of attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors in response to environmental change. Testing this link is crucial to document environment human feedbacks. Few studies document this effect, and we know of no studies that have documented this within a true experimental design.

</p>

<p>

  Specific duties of the RA. During AY 2005 2006, Liz will have several duties.

</p>

<p>

  1) She will conduct the post treatment interviews of respondents at NDV. This is a labor intensive activity, as our previous interviews have averaged anywhere from 45 minutes to over one hour (in addition to the one hour round trip commute to and from Mesa and Tempe). This will be the bulk of Lizs duties, and it is the task that most requires RA support. She will also assist in the design of the post treatment survey instrument.

</p>

<p>

  2) She will continue transcription of the interviews. Although the quantitative measurement from the first survey has been entered into a dataset, we also generated qualitative data by digitally recording the interviews. Qualitative data is a valuable complement to the quantitative survey responses. Although the digital audio files are available to CAP LTER researchers to listen to, audio files must be transcribed and coded so that qualitative, text based analysis can be applied. Transcription is a time intensive task, and Liz will continue work on this.

</p>

<p>

  3) Liz will continue to help us in the generation of manuscripts. As noted below, Liz has helped in the preparation or authorship of two papers. In AY 2004 2005, Scott Yabiku began training Liz in how to use SPSS, which is a statistical program used for quantitative data analysis. Thus in AY 2005 2006 Liz will be able to assist in the analysis of data as well as the writing of manuscripts.

<p>: Hierarchical Spatial Modeling of Multiple  Soil Nutrients and Carbon in Heterogeneous Land Use Patches of the Phoenix Metropolitan Area,</p>

<p>  with Nancy Grimm, Corinna Gries, Diane Hope, Jason Kaye and Richard Burdick.</p>

    <h2>Abstract:</h2>

  <p>Modeling multivariate soil data using a suit of biophysical and socio-economic variables has been of interest to ecologists. There is a need for explanatory models, which give insight into the process of controls on spatial variability of soil nutrients and carbon concentrations and indicate how they differ in different within and among land-use types. We propose a hierarchical modeling specification which takes into account the spatial covariates as well as the inter-dependent nature of the different soil nutrients and carbon. We develop a model to explain variability in soil nutrients and carbon pools in the for the Central Arizona Phoenix Metropolitan region where land-use has changed considerably over the years due to socio-economic among other changes in the region. Comparison of how these factors affect the soil nutrients provides insight as to how socio-economics influence changes in ecology. Our model included 13 geomorphic, ecologic, and socio-economic independent variables that were used to predict soil total N, organic C, inorganic C, and extractable PO43. Using six levels of hierarchy we fit a suitable spatial hierarchical model. We compare prediction results from standard models and show that our model is richer and so is the interpretation. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that applies hierarchical bayesian modeling techniques to study multivariate soil nutrient and carbon concentrations. We conclude a discussion of our findings and indication of the broader ecological applicability of our modeling style.

"120","Effects of the urban atmosphere on Sonoran Desert ecosystems","
<p>Rates of nitrogen deposition have increased in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, but few studies have examined the impacts of long-term nutrient enrichment on ecological processes in deserts. We are monitoring nitrogen deposition and conducting a multi-year, nutrient-addition study within 15 Sonoran Desert sites across the rapidly growing metropolitan area of Phoenix, Arizona (USA). We hypothesize that desert plants and soils are sensitive to the urban atmosphere and nutrient enrichment, but that these effects will vary among types of organisms that differ in terms of physiological responsiveness, proximity to surface nitrogen sources, and magnitude of carbon or water limitation.

</p>","<p>We are measuring nitrogen deposition and ecosystem pools and processes at 15 native Sonoran Desert sites located across the Phoenix metropolitan area. Nitrogen deposition. We are estimating seasonal inorganic nitrogen deposition using ion-exchange resin collectors and inferential methods.  We located ion-exchange resins columns at each site both in the open (bulk deposition) and under <l>Larrea tridentata</l> (creosote bush) shrubs (throughfall deposition).  We also are also monitoring atmospheric concentrations of nitrogen gases (NOx, NO2, NH3, and HNO3) at two sites, one located in downtown Phoenix, and one located in the east valley.</p>

<p><b> Fertilization plots:</b>  In 2005, we established four 20-m x 20-m plots with a 5-m buffer at each site.  Each plot includes at least five individuals of <i>Larrea tridentata</l> and five individuals of <l>Ambrosia deltoidea</l> or <l>Ambrosia dumosa</l> (bursage).  Nutrient treatments of ambient (no fertilizer, i.e. ‘control’), nitrogen, phosphorus, and both nitrogen and phosphorus together were assigned randomly to plots.  Fertilization began in December 2005 and continues every 6 months, broadcast as solids by hand at 60 kg nitrogen hectare-1 year-1 as NH4NO3.  Phosphorus is applied as triple superphosphate at 12 kg P hectare-1 year-1.</p> 

<p><b>Growth of perennial shrubs:</b>  We are estimating seasonal growth of the perennial shrub <l>L. tridentata</l> by measuring elongation of stems in April (growth from October-April; winter/spring) and in October (growth from April-October; summer/fall).  We select one apical stem from each of four cardinal directions on each of 5 individual plants per plot.  We mark each stem with tape several cm from the tip, measured at the beginning of the growth interval, and we calculate stem elongation as the difference in stem length from the beginning to the end of the measurement interval.</p>  

<p><b>Growth of herbaceous annual plants:</b>  We are estimating growth of spring annual plants in all plots by harvesting total herbaceous aboveground biomass at peak production.  In 2008, we identified and permanently marked four 1-m2 quadrats within each plot, two under <l> L. tridentata</l> shrubs and two in inter-plant spaces.  In the spring, we harvest total herbaceous biomass from one quarter of each 1-m2 quadrat (from a 0.25-m2 sub-plot).  Soil nitrogen content.  In control plots at each site, we are measuring winter and summer inorganic soil nitrogen content using Plant Root Simulator probes.  Four sets of anion-cation probes are placed in each plot, two sets under two different <l> L. tridentata</l> shrubs, and another two sets in inter-plant spaces.</p>  

<p>Herbivory:  In 10 sites located in the urban core (N=5) and in the east valley (N=5), we are measuring the effects of herbivory on growth and composition of desert herbaceous annual plants.  Near each control plot, we constructed three, 1 m x 1 m mesh cages (‘exclosures’) to exclude small mammal and avian herbivores, and three ‘control’ cages of the same size that allowed herbivore access to the plots.  We placed one set of Plant Root Simulator probes two of each exclosure and control plot in each site to monitor soil inorganic nitrogen availability.  In 2011 and 2012, we watered the plots with an additional 31 mm of artificial precipitation from December to March due to low ambient rainfall received during these two spring seasons.  In March of each year, we assess plant community composition and harvest each plot for total aboveground biomass.<p/>  

<p>Movement of nitrogen in deep soils:  In 2010, we measured pools of inorganic nitrogen and chloride (as a conservative tracer) in deep soil cores in control and nitrogen fertilized plots within a subset of sites to explore the fate of nitrogen additions. </p>

<p> Community composition and function of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms:  We are measuring community composition and nitrogen processing rates of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and archaea in the control and nitrogen fertilized plots, and under legumes, in several of the project sites.

"122","Points, patches and regions: Scaling soil biogeochemical patterns in an urbanized arid ecosystem","<p>Cities are rapidly growing throughout the world and are altering biologic processes in many regions with global consequences.  Urbanization in the Phoenix, USA metropolitan region has dramatically altered regional ecosystem patterns, but little is known about how these changes have influenced soil organic matter, total nitrogen, and the distribution of nitrogen stable isotopes.  Because urban development is a phenomenon occurring at multiple scales, ecological consequences of urbanization will likely differ between individual patches and the entire metropolitan region.  To investigate such changes we conducted spatially explicit surveys including three dominant land-use types in this region:  native desert, agriculture, and mesic residential.  These data were combined for analysis with previously collected samples from a synoptic regional survey.  A landscape scaling approach was implemented to compare the dependence of soil variability on the sampled extent and the uncertainty associated with scaling from points to patches, land-use types, and the Phoenix metropolitan region.  The multiple-scale analysis of soil properties showed that variation in total soil nitrogen, soil organic matter, and Î´15N content of soils differed significantly between patch and regional scales.  The majority of variation in the urbanized patch types was exhibited between patches while for the native desert the majority of variation was observed within individual patches.  These differences show the impact of urbanization on scaling relations.  Overall, urbanization in this region appears to have increased soil organic matter by 44%, total nitrogen by 48%, and has elevated Î´15N by 21%.</p>

<p>

  Mycorrhizal relationships were studied at an experimental xeric urban landscaped site in Phoenix, Arizona. One study quantified the local diversity and spatial patterns of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) species. AMF species at 25 points in a 9.2 Ã 9.2 m regular grid pattern were identified using trap cultures. A total of twelve species were detected, with seven species detected in one plot and eleven in the other. Sampling effort curves and jackknife estimates indicate that a limited number of species was still undetected. No single species was dominant at either plot, and a rank-frequency plot for the site revealed a log-normal species distribution. The number of AMF species was not correlated with proximity to plants. Despite the patchiness of plants in the plots, the number of species detected per point exhibited spatial structuring only at the smallest sampling scale in a single plot, and only a single species in each plot was non-randomly distributed. The results indicate that there is a diverse AMF propagule bank at the site and/or there has been significant in-migration from the surrounding metacommunity.

</p>
The second study examined the effects of three shoot pruning techniques (shearing every 6 weeks, heading back every 6 months and renewal pruning every year) on root length density, biomass, AMF colonization and soil respiration in two woody shrubs, Nerium oleander (oleander) and Leucophyllum frutescens (Texas sage). Roots were sampled at the base of plants by soil coring to depths of 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm in February, after the shearing and heading back treatments had been imposed, but prior to the first renewal pruning, and in May, after all treatments had been imposed. Shearing stimulated root biomass in Nerium in February, but shearing and renewal pruning reduced biomass compared to unpruned plants in both species in May. Nerium colonization was stimulated by shearing and heading back in February and by shearing and renewal pruning in May. Root biomass, length, and soil respiration associated with Leucophyllum were reduced by all pruning treatments in May. The results indicate that heading back may be the most appropriate pruning practice for these shrubs in xeric landscaping.

<p>

  Geostatistical methods provide novel approaches for analyzing spatial patterns of ecological phenomena. We employed two kriging methods (ordinary and indicator) in our analyses of three bird species known to differentially occupy the urban to rural gradient within the Phoenix metropolitan area and surrounding desert (Arizona, USA). Ordinary kriging interpolates values between measurements; however, it requires normally distributed data, which is commonly invalidated in ecological censuses. Indicator kriging is not able to produce numerical predictions of measurements, but has the advantages of not requiring normality and requiring fewer decisions to be made. Avian census monitoring was conducted seasonally at forty sites for two years at an extent encompassing the Phoenix metropolitan and surrounding desert. We aggregated these counts and selected three resident bird species to exhibit how these ecologically distinct avian species differentially occupy the urban to exurban gradient through the process of interpolation. Each of these species exhibited strong deviations from normality due to many observations of zero or one. Given the skewness of the data, we anticipated that indicator kriging would be a more appropriate method of interpolation. However, we found that both methods adequately captured spatial distribution of the three species and are sufficient for creating distribution maps of avian species. With additional census monitoring, kriging can be used to detect long-term changes in population distribution of avian and other wildlife populations.

<p>

  An object-oriented approach was utilized in the development of two urban landcover classification schemes utilizing high-resolution (0.6m), true-color aerial photography. The imagery was segmented into classifiable polygons through a two-tiered segmentation process. A preliminary segmentation level was resegmented based on the spectral similarity of neighboring objects, merging larger objects (e.g. houses and roads), yet retaining the fine-scale segmentation of smaller, more heterogeneous objects (e.g. trees). An initial classification scheme was developed for a sample area within the Phoenix metropolitan area, and was heavily weighted by standard nearest neighbor functions generated by samples from each of the classes, which produced an enhanced accuracy (84%). A second classification was developed from the hierarchical structure of initial classification scheme in which all parameters were transformed into a fuzzy rule set, creating a product transportable to different areas of interest of the same imagery, or for use in similar imagery of different times for landcover change detection. A comprehensive accuracy assessment revealed a slightly lower overall accuracy of 79% for the rule set based classification. These differences to an optimal classification for the given data sets and classes are very little. We conclude that the transportable classification scheme is satisfactory for general landcover analyses; yet classification accuracy can be enhance at site-specific venues with the incorporation of nearest neighbor functions using class samples.

  We present a classification procedure in order to adequately delineate woody vegetation in an arid urban ecosystem using high resolution, color infrared aerial photography for Leipzig, Germany. We adopted an object-oriented approach due to the physical nature of high-resolution photography, in which the objects of interest were composed of few to many pixels. These pixels were regionally grouped based on the similarity of adjacent pixels into polygonal objects. These objects were then spectrally analyzed for discrimination between woody vegetation and all other objects. The classification was then parameterized to highlight woody vegetation for further environmental and ecological modeling. Accuracy assessment within subclasses was then conducted. The outset of this procedure produces a binary matrix where the entire raster set is classified highlighting the elements of the urban forest.

For example, recent studies have documented substantial levels of ecological variation within urban aggregations (e.g. population density of spiders and their prey, spider body mass, and spider nutrient composition),  but little population genetic variation across these urban aggregations—suggesting to us that urban fragmentation is complex, but that gene flow for urban arthropods may be extensive.  Current studies are aimed at mapping phenotypic correlates (behavior and morphology) to this genetic and ecological variation.

  Research Article 2: Does Urbanization Affect Soil-Nitrogen And Soil-Carbon Concentrations? with  Jason Kaye, Corinna Gries and Diane Hope,. 

</p>
<p>

  Abstract:Soil is a natural resource that provides important ecosystem services. For example, in soils carbon and nutrients are cycled and soil can help to clean both water and air. Much of our drinking water is filtered through soil as it moves into ground and surface waters. Poorly managed, soils can serve as a pipeline for pollutants, such as nitrate, into groundwater, silt into surface waters and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere. The condition of the soil ecosystem is also crucial to sustaining agricultural productivity and important in terms of providing a long term sink for atmospheric carbon (Senanayeke, 1993). Soils are also a sink for anthropogenic nutrient pollution (Aber et al., 1998).

  In unmanaged ecosystems organic matter is maintained  in a dynamic equilibrium and the soil ecosystem is  effective at conserving fixed carbon. However, some land management practices can reduce soil organic matter.  For example, modern agriculture decreases organic matter content of soil.  As soil organic matter storage declines, the carbon that would be stored in soil is released to the atmosphere as  CO_2. Considerable attention has been given recently to interaction between the past and present soil organic carbon levels and global warming via the green-house effect. Soil nitrogen pool sizes affect plant productivity and thus , the movement of CO_2 from the atmosphere to ecosystems. Thus two of the most basic metrics  of this ecosystem structure are the quantities of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stored in soil. In areas such as the Phoenix metropolitan area where the land- use pattern has been changing drastically over the past 90 years due to rapid urban growth, among the questions that need to be answered is the following: How will soil N and C levels respond to increases in urbanization of former desert and agricultural ecosystems? The purpose of our study was to examine how the spatial patterns of N and C concentrations in the soil of the Phoenix metropolitan area vary with land-use and other socio-economic factors due to urbanization.

"145","Spatial and Temporal Elemental Deposition Patterns across Maricopa County","
<p>

  Lichens are often used as longterm integrators of elemental deposition patterns.  Previous research by Zschau and Nash in Maricopa County, Arizona has used lichens of the genus 
 to determine sources and trends in elemental deposition patterns for the region, with an emphasis on heavy metals. The purpose of this investigation is to resurvey MaricopaCounty and examine any temporal changes in elemental deposition patterns.  Lichens will be analyzed for elemental content using high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrophotometry (HR ICP MS), which improves the sensitivity relative to the previously used ICP MS, potentially allowing patterns for additional elements to be determined. Comparisons with the previous investigation, as well as analysis of older specimens collected in the county and stored in the ASU Lichen Herbarium, will help to provide a baseline from which temporal trends can be derived. Multivariate and spatial analysis of elemental patterns is expected to yield both current spatial deposition patterns and temporal trends in such elemental deposition for the region.

  1. General Description

</p>
<p>

      As long-lived, slow-growing organisms, lichens are useful as surrogate receptors in atmospheric deposition monitoring investigations, where the integration of long-term signals requires monitoring (Nash 1989, Garty 2001). Because they do not possess nutrient absorbing roots, as found in vascular plants, they have a major dependence on atmospheric sources of nutrients (Nieboer et al. 1978, Nieboer and Richardson 1980). Compared to soil nutrient pools, atmospheric concentrations of nutrients are quite low, and consequently nutrient concentrating mechanisms, such as particulate trapping (Garty et al. 1979), uptake to cell wall exchange sites or transport intracellularly (Beckett and Brown 1984; Brown and Beckett 1985), sequestering in complexes formed with lichen secondary metabolites (Purvis et al. 1987) or impaction of aerosols (Knops et al. 1996) are important for lichens.Â  As a consequence, lichens have often been used as surrogate receptors for atmospheric deposition of radionuclides (e.g. Palmer et al. 1965, Seaward et al. 1988, Biazrov 1994) and various other atmospheric pollutants (Puckett 1988, Nash and Gries 1995). When an appropriate stratified sampling design (e.g. with respect to lichen species choice, microhabitat characteristics, atmospheric exposure, etc.) is employed, then both local and regional deposition patterns are readily discerned (Bruteig 1993, Loppi and Bargagli 1996, Muir et al. 1993, Nash 1996), although care must be taken in the assessment of baseline levels (Gough et al. 1988; Bennett 2000).

</p>
<p>

      In an earlier investigation Zschau et al. (2003), determined past spatial patterns of atmospheric deposition across Maricopa County, Arizona, in 1998, based on samples from 28 sites, as analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrophotometry (ICP-MS). The county is approximately L-shaped, extending over 200 km along its two longer axes, and contains the Phoenix metropolitan area, one of the fastest growing urban regions in the world. Although heavy industry is minimal within the Phoenix area, Arizona has historically been an important source of copper.Â  Major sources of spatial elemental variation included copper mining and smelting (in an adjacent county), anthropogenic sources associated with the urban center (e.g. lead) and location of special geological features, such as mafic rocks with elevated concentrations of Co, Cr, Ni, and Sc relative to average abundances in the Earth s crust. In addition, temporal comparisons for six of the same sites within the county were possible, based on collections made in the mid-1970 s (Nash et al. 2003), where sufficient lichen material was available for analysis. Decreases in copper (cessation of smelting) and lead (switch to unleaded gasoline) were demonstrable and increases in zinc (not shown) were found. Because of the success of the earlier investigation, a resurvey of these sites was specifically included in the 2nd round of funding for CAPLTER.

</p>
<p>

      The genus 
 is selected as the most suitable biomonitor of metal deposition in the MaricopaCounty region, because it is one of the few macrolichens where readily obtaining enough material for analysis is possible in arid areas (Nash et al. 1977). It is easily recognizable in the field, is present at many sites locally, and has previously been used for similar investigations (Zschau et al. 2003; Nash et al. 2003) whereby the sites were sampled in 1998. Spatial patterns of atmospheric deposition of trace elements to these epilithic lichens will be assessed using the same 28 sites investigated previously.

</p>
<p>

      The lichen material will be cleaned, wet digested and analyzed by a High Resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectophotometer (HR-ICP-MS) for a suite of elemental concentrations (antimony [Sb], cadmium [Cd], cerium [Ce], chromium [Cr], cobalt [Co], copper [Cu], dysprosium [Dy], europium [Eu], gadolinium [Gd], gold [Au], holmium [Ho], lead [Pb], lutetium [Lu], neodymium [Nd], nickel [Ni], palladium [Pd], platinum [Pt], praseodymium [Pr], samarium [Sm], scandium [Sc], silver [Ag], terbium [Tb], thulium [Tm], tin [Sn], uranium [U], vanadium [V], ytterbium [Yb], yttrium [Y], and zinc [Zn]).Â  The ASU HR-ICP-MS has greater resolution than the ICP-MS used in the earlier investigation; consequently, we anticipate obtaining data for more elements than the 17 elements, for which Zschau (1999) obtained complete data sets (8 other elements were below the detection limits for at least one site). Nevertheless, obtaining complete datasets for all 29 elements listed above is unlikely.

</p>
<p>

      In the laboratory, lichen thalli of approximately 6-8 cm in diameter will be selected, removed from the rock substrate with plastic forceps and cleaned thoroughly using nano-pure water. This cleaning step, conducted in a laminar flow unit to limit contamination by the prep person, will remove most of the surficial particulates, though some remaining particlesÂ  may have to be removed by sonication. The cleaned thalli will be stored in nitric acid-washed beakers until air-dry. To minimize intra-thalline and inter-thalline elemental variation at each sampling site (Loppi and Bargagli 1996), the lichen material will then be frozen with liquid nitrogen, crushed in a clean mortar and pestle, and homogenized. Previous experiments tested elemental recoveries of different digestion procedures (Zschau et al. 2003).Â  For the lichen samples, conventional wet digestion procedures, using concentrated nitric acid and hydrochloric acid digestion, was selected as the best procedure.Â  

</p>
<p>

      Digestion procedures for the HR ICP-MS will have to be developed using techniques from previous work as a starting point.Â  The student will begin by developing a digestion procedure that does not use hydrochloric acid under the direction of Dr. Shock s staff.Â  Also available in the laboratory is a MARS 5 microwave digester.Â  Digestion techniques using the microwave digester will be developed using samples from previous surveys.Â  The accuracy of the digestion procedure will be checked against the lichen standard obtained from the International Atomic Energy Agency.

</p>
<p>

      Before quantitative analysis, samples will be spiked with indium (selected because it is mono-isotopic, near the middle of the mass range, and not an element of interest to this study) as an internal calibration standard. Elemental concentrations for a suite of 28 trace metals in each sample will be quantified using high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS).Â  Blanks will be run along the entire sample preparation procedure and should be uniformly much lower than the replicates from the same location.

</p>
<p>

      Means of the triplicate, independent digestions per location and their respective standard deviations will be calculated. These parameters and the original data will be made available at http//ces.asu.edu. Using the PC-ORD software (McCune and Mefford 1999), two methods will be employed to examine spatial patterns of elemental concentration of those elements that were above detection levels at all sites. First, the data matrix for the cluster analysis (Ward s method) will be transformed to the sums of standard deviations to reduce the amount of chaining present in the groupings of locations and elements.Â  Results will be graphed in the form of dendrograms.Â  Second, principal component analysis (PCA) will be used to reduce dimensionality and explain the main sources of variation, as the initial principal components. Normal probability plots for each principal component will be used to assess the underlying assumption of normality. The final results of the PCA s will be graphed as two- or three-dimensional ordination plots. Furthermore, the results of the PCA s can be further refined by factor analysis to help identify elemental source (e.g. Sloff 1995; Rahn and Huanh 1999).Â  Surface maps for concentrations of at least cadmium, lead, copper, nickel, and zinc will be interpolated among the locations using ArcGIS Geostatistics and Spatial Analyst packages.Â  All data files will be converted into UTM 1983, zone 12 format, which offers the best map projection of the target.Â  The following ArcGIS Geostatistics settings are anticiptated to best resolve the spatial pollution patterns (based on Zschau et al. 1999), and will, therefore, be used to interpolate the surfaces:

</p>
<p>

  1. Interpolation Mode:Â  Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW).Â  The interpolator assumes that input points have a local influence that decreases with distance.

</p>
<p>

  2. Interpolator settings:Â  spatial resolution 300 map units, nearest neighbor analysis, 20 points, power = 5, and no barriers. Other workers (Gailey et al. 1985) have modeled pollution patterns using a 4th order polynomial fit.

</p>
<p>

  The interpolated surfaces will be clipped to the target regions borders using GIS data from the Arizona Land Resource Information System (ALRIS).Â  Geology, topology, traffic, urbanization, and mining activities will be also evaluated using ALRIS and USGS DEM maps.Â  Historical industrial emissions for some elements will be collected from the toxic release inventory (TRI) from the US Environmental Protection Agency, and spatial localities indexed to the interpolated maps.Â  Because the 
 grows on rocks, part of the elemental variation observed in the area will doubtlessly be related to underlying variation in geology and associated blowing dust. Accordingly, it will be necessary to interpret the results in terms of basic knowledge of geochemistry (e.g. Levinson 1974; Taylor and McLennan 1985) as well as specific knowledge of the geochemistry in the region (e.g. Reynolds 1988; Titley and Anthony 1989). Because known pollution sources are present in the region, the results will also have to be interpreted in light of known emission data (e.g. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1997).

  This project will conduct a comparative environmental justice study of the Phoenix and Baltimore metropolitan areas. We will examine inequitable distributions of environmental disamenities (point source pollution, ambient air pollution, transportation corridors,  heat island),  and environmental amenities (public green space, recreation facilities, public parks, clean air).  The study is comparative, documenting and analyzing  patterns of environmental equity/inequity between the Baltimore and Phoenix LTER sites. We examine both process and outcome equity using a longitudinal approach. The research will utilize existing LTER data bases and environmental models as well as acquire new public access data to map and analyze equity pattern and processes. The research will satisfy the mandate of cross-site research in the LTER network and will form the basis of leveraging additional funding for new research.

"148","Dynamics of Water Supply and Delivery","
<p>

  The proposed work follows exactly from that written in the CAP LTER renewal proposal.  Whereas previous water-research efforts at CAP LTER have focused upon water and landscape management and a preliminary water budget for the metro area, we recognize a need for a more complex hydrologic cycle, with natural variability altered by the need to supply water for human activities and protect from floods. Controlled management activities shift the characteristic spatial and temporal variability of the system, leading to ecological consequences, human perceptions of change, and further institutional responses. This pattern can lead to vulnerabilities and unanticipated ecological consequences, inability to recognize key processes, and reduced capacity to withstand perturbations.

</p>
<p>

  The proposed work will achieve a better understanding of the hydrologic cycle and the partitioning of water into both supply and use categories, with both historic and forward-looking perspectives, relying initially on a datamining approach. A spatially explicit model will be developed that is readily updated in the future, but be modular and flexible enough to incorporate near real-time data from federal or local agencies.  The goal for this 9-month RA will be to develop a dynamic understanding of water supply and delivery of surface and ground waters plus hydrologic precipitation-runoff sources.

</p>
<p>

  The graduate student will build upon the past work by CAP LTER on a hydrologic balance.  For example, it will build on recent work by ADEQ on estimations of groundwater storage.  More importantly it will establish a framework (model) into which dynamic datasources (streamflow gauge data) can be integrated into a dynamic water supply and deliver model.  The dynamic nature of the model will show monthly variations in water supply and delivery, rather than annual mass balances.  Data from SRP, CAP, and ADWR will be ??mined?.  In addition for two different types of cities (Scottsdale and Tempe) we will get flows from the water treatment plants and wastewater treatment plants to understand how much potable water returns to wastewater treatment plants.  The model will also be expanded to be spatially explicit, using city boundaries as the first line of delineation.  Finally, mass balance equations will be added into the model to account for fluxes of aqueous chemicals that behave either conservatively (e.g., salts) or are reactive (e.g., nitrate). The modeling framework will be compatible with other CAP LTER cyberinfrastructure efforts.

  Title: Land cover change and its effects on ecosystems

</p>
<p>

  This proposed research is part of the long-term project on modeling the ecological responses to environmental changes induced by urbanization in the Phoenix Metropolitan Region.  Since the summer of 2005, we have we conducted a simulation experimental study to investigate how NPP, biomass, and C/N cycles of Sonoran desert respond to changes in temperature, CO2, and N deposition in the Phoenix region.  This work has been submitted to Global Change Biology recently in collaboration with W. Shen (former postdoc at LEML), N. Grimm, and D. Hope.  This analysis focused on one dominant Sonoran ecosystem type.  

</p>
<p>

  To assess ecosystem responses at the regional landscape level, we must obtain reliable estimates of the spatial distribution of several other types of ecosystems and their temporal changes.  Thus, for the summer of 2006,we propose to do this using the time series of remote sensing data existing at CAPLTER using GIS and remote sensing techniques including spectral mixing procedures developed by Alex Buyantuyev at our lab (LEML).  Secondly, I will develop a up-scaling approach to extrapolating ecosystem-level responses to the regional scale.

  The study will be carried out primarily at Wu s Landscape Ecology and Modeling Laboratory in collaboration with Alex Buyantuyev, Corinna Gries, and other CAPLTER researchers.'Spatial and time series analysis methods used in landscape ecology and remote sensing will be used for this study.Â  Several different up-scaling approaches developed in ecology and earth sciences will be examined.Â  The new modeling paradigm of pattern-oriented modeling will also be reviewed for its relevance and potential for the CAPLTER project.Â  We plan to develop two manuscripts based on this study.

The LTER goals for 2006 PASS are to: 1) establish baseline data for long-term social monitoring of environmental perceptions, values, knowledge and behavior that transform the ecosystem in the study region; 2) achieve a higher degree of integration between studies of social behavior and studies of the biophysical environment in the study region; 3) examine how socioeconomic inequalities are related to spatial variations in ecosystem characteristics; and 4) study the effects of environmental feedbacks to the comfort, health, and well-being of diverse social groups who share the urban environment.  

</p>
<p>

  PASS is an LTER project-wide activity that relates to all of the IPAs.  The value of this survey to CAP LTER lies in both the social data that tell us about the people who live here and the local area context of ecosystem characteristics studied by ecologists, climatologists, and other CAP scientists. This project has required a substantial investment of my time for the past 6 months.  In September 2005 we began in earnest with meetings of the planning group and sub-groups, which continued throughout the 2005 fall semester.  There are 20 individuals from a dozen departments and programs that worked on the content of the survey and the selection of the sample of 40 neighborhoods.  This spring semester I am working closely with the Institute for Social Science Research (ISSR) on the finalization of the survey and design of associated materials, the field visits to canvass neighborhoods, and all the details that are required to make a successful social survey.  Data collection from individual households will be from late March through late May.   

</p>
<p>

  PASS 2006 will continue to absorb a large amount of my time throughout the summer.  When the data collection is underway, I will turn my attention to integrating other data streams with the 40 neighborhood locations in order to make the survey more useful to a broader range of CAP LTER projects.  This will involve coordinating the GIS work that needs to be done on geo-coding neighborhoods and homes in our sample in order to add tax assessor data on homes and lots, vegetation indexes, air temperature and air quality measures, U.S. Census block group data, and so forth, to the data base.  I will need to work with CAP LTER and ISSR data managers and student research assistants in order to have this done.  In addition, when the survey data are returned to me, probably sometime in June, I will need to orient myself and the other PASS research team members to the data, set up policies and procedures for using the data, and produce a summary of the main findings.  In addition, I find that an increasing number of individuals want to meet with me after they hear about PASS (for example, after my talk at the ASM on February 20).  Once results of the study start to circulate, I expect more requests for information.  These requests may lead to new ways of expanding and extending the survey.   

</p>
<p>

  I have never received any CAP LTER summer salary.  I am requesting it this year because the project is demanding a substantial amount of my time and since PASS has become a core LTER activity, my work is going to benefit quite a few people who are on the research team as well as others who will use the data in the future.

  The design of PASS 2006 builds upon the long-term ecological monitoring strategy of Survey 200. The sampling frame for PASS neighborhoods is the Survey 200, which was designed to obtain a spatially dispersed, unbiased sample of 204 points across all main land use types in the Phoenix metropolitan area.'Of the U.S. Census block groups that overlay the plots, 94 were classified in 2005 as predominantly urban land use.Â  The 40 PASS neighborhoods (boundaries defined by block groups) are co-located with some of the urbanized Survey 200 sites in order to take advantage of spatially-referenced datasets that can be used to understand the context and surroundings of the sites.Â  The sample of 40 neighborhoods was selected to represent diversity in community socioeconomic status, racial/ethnic composition, age of population, housing types, and core-suburban-fringe location. The locations cover the entire CAP LTER study area.Â  Twenty housing units in each of the 40 selected block groups are randomly selected in order to produce a sample size of 800 households.Â  Thus, the PASS database can be analyzed at multiple spatial scales:Â  individual housing units, neighborhoods, and metropolitan region.Â  Social surveys are the primary means of data collection and these data are joined to other social and biophysical data streams as described above.

"153","Academic Year 2006-2007 Research Assistant Request for the Phoenix Area Social Survey","
<p>

  This is a request for a graduate research assistant (RA) during academic year 2006-2007 for the Phoenix Area Social Survey.  The RA will work to support the project director and other CAP LTER and DCDC scientists in the analysis of the 2006 Phoenix Area Social Survey (PASS).  The LTER goals for 2006 PASS are to: 1) establish baseline data for long-term social monitoring of environmental perceptions, values, knowledge and behavior that transform the ecosystem in the study region; 2) achieve a higher degree of integration between studies of social behavior and studies of the biophysical environment in the study region; 3) examine how socioeconomic inequalities are related to spatial variations in ecosystem characteristics; and 4) study the effects of environmental feedbacks to the comfort, health, and well-being of diverse social groups who share the urban environment.  

</p>
<p>

  PASS is an LTER project-wide activity that relates to all of the IPAs.  The value of this survey to CAP LTER lies in both the social data that tell us about the people who live here and the local area context of ecosystem characteristics studied by ecologists, climatologists, and other CAP scientists.  During the 2005-2006 academic year, funding for a half-time PASS RA was shared by the NSF supplemental grant for PASS and the School of Human Evolution and Social Change.  Darren Ruddell, first-year Ph.D. student in Geography, was involved in all stages of the planning, preparation, sampling design, and field work for the PASS survey.  I have applied to SHESC to continue sharing the cost of his support during the summer 2006.  I expect to complete the survey data collection this spring and to move into the next stages of data integration and analysis beginning this summer and extending into next year.   

</p>
<p>

  I am applying for CAP LTER support for an RA in 2006-2007 in order to have assistance available that will make PASS immediately useful to the research team and soon to a broad range of other CAP LTER projects.  Through geo-coding the locations of neighborhoods and homes in our sample, we expect to merge tax assessor data on homes and lots, vegetation indexes, air temperature and air quality measures, U.S. Census block group data, and so forth, with the PASS data base.  This work may or may not be able to be completed this summer.  There are several open-ended questions in PASS that will require coding schemes to be developed.  Thus, one task of the 2006-2007 RA will be to complete any of this work that remains to be finished.  In addition, the RA will need to have computer file management skills and facility with GIS, SPSS or SAS, and other software in order to support the analyses of PASS researchers who will use the data.  Answering requests for information about PASS will also be part of this job description.  I also expect that new requests for data preparation and integration will be forthcoming when the PASS data are available. A graduate student with a quantitative background in the social sciences would be suitable for this position.  I do not know who this student will be at this point.

<b>RA Support Request for Elizabeth (Liz) Farley-Metzger</b>


</p>
<p>

  
<b>1) A general description of the project(s) the RA will work on, including where it fits into the overall plans for the IPA.</b>


</p>
<p>

  Our project is titled ""Monitoring Human-Environment Interactions in a Controlled Landscaping Experiment.""  This project is the social science component of CAP-LTER s landscaping experiment at North Desert Village (NDV) on the ASU East Campus.  Initial funding for this project was provided by a pilot grant from the College of Liberal Arts (PI Scott Yabiku, other investigators were Patricia Gober, David Casagrande, Charles Redman, Nancy Grimm, Elizabeth Wentz, and Sharon Harlan), and later support has come from CAP-LTER.  The aim of this project is to study the reciprocal relationships between humans and their immediate residential environment.

</p>
<p>

  This project fits into the human control of biodiversity IPA in that it is a prime way in which human-environmental feedbacks are closely monitored.  Although extensive human measurement is happening in other parts of CAP-LTER, such as the PASS survey, our NDV project aims to monitor human behavior in as tightly a controlled experimental setting as possible.  Thus the NDV social measurement has unique strengths not found in other LTER projects.

</p>
<p>

  
<b>2) Specific duties of the RA</b>


</p>
<p>

  a) Liz will assist in the data analysis of the pre- and post-treatment data.  We are taking a quantitative and qualitative approach to data analysis.  Scott Yabiku has already tutored Liz in how to use SPSS, a statistical data software package.  David Casagrande, who is no longer at ASU but continues to have strong ties to the NDV project, has just started qualitative, textual analysis of the transcripts from the pre-treatment survey, and he plans to guide Liz in how to do this type of analysis.  

</p>
<p>

  b) Liz will begin to explore and create links between social and biophysical data.  In a recent conversation, Marcia Nation and I thought that it is important to begin truly integrating the different data sources at NDV.  The whole purpose of NDV was to intensely monitor the site from a wide array of scientific angles??ecological, social, physical, biological.  This intense monitoring is proceeding successfully, but I believe we are not as successful linking between these disciplines.  In the next academic year, I d like to have Liz see what types of analyses could use data from multiple disciplines.  In the process, Liz might need to help the LTER Data Manager develop a common identifier system in which all the data from the housing units can merged together.  I believe that if we first have a common way to link datasets across disciplines, then it is easier to analyze the linked data and ultimately write manuscripts.

</p>
<p>

  c) Liz will continue to help us in the generation of manuscripts.  By summer 2006, we will have completed the post-treatment interviews.  This will then allow us to examine potential changes in human measurement from pre- to post-treatment.  As far as we know, no other researchers have done a manipulative landscaping experiment on actual residents, and thus we believe these results will be highly innovative.

</p>
<p>

  
<b>3) Name and qualifications (e.g., narrative or CV) of the student who is proposed to fill the position (if known).</b>


</p>
<p>

  The qualifications and previous experience of Elizabeth Farley-Metzger will allow her to continue to make contributions to this project.  She is in the master s program in Anthropology.  Her excellent scholarship was recognized by being chosen as an IGERT Associate, which provided her with travel funds and the opportunity to participate in IGERT training and research activities.  She used some of these funds to present NDV findings at the 2005 annual meeting of The Society for Human Ecology (SHE).  Liz also has a committed research interest in the NDV project because she is using the data for her master s thesis.

</p>
<p>

  
<b>4) Amount of time RA support is requested (one or two semesters; if one semester, please indicate whether fall or spring semester)</b>


</p>
<p>

  Ideally, we are requesting two semesters of support.  If that is not possible, Fall would be preferable to Spring.

</p>
<p>

  
<b>5) If applicable, results from previous RA support received by the student (including publications, datasets, etc.). </b>


</p>
<p>

  Liz has made substantial contributions as a CAP-LTER RA:

</p>
<p>

  a) Proposals: Liz assisted me in preparing a proposal (PI: Yabiku) that I submitted to NIH in October 2005.  This proposal has yet to be reviewed (I ve been told it will be reviewed at the end of March 2006), but if eventually funded it would provide substantial support ($496,000 in total costs) for work on demographic, population, and environment issues in PASS, DCDC, and NDV.

</p>
<p>

  b) Datasets: Liz is the person who has conducted the pre-treatment NDV interviews in Spring 2004, and she will conduct the first post-treatment interviews in Spring 2006.  These interviews are the foundation of the NDV social measurement.  The pre-treatment dataset is available on the LTER network drives, as is a codebook explaining its structure.  The post-treatment interviews will result in another dataset.

</p>
<p>

  c) Publications:

<p>

  Urban trees contribute significantly to human health and environmental quality but assessments of their health are rare.  This project involved developing an urban tree health monitoring protocol for use in the Southwestern US and using it to conduct field assessments of urban tree health in the Phoenix urban ecosystem during the winter/spring of 2006.  Field manuals prepared by the USDA Forest Service for use in monitoring urban forest health (Cumming et al. 2001) were adapted to reflect the unique stresses and diseases that occur in urban areas in the southwestern US.  Tree health was then assessed using  a subset of  field plots have been established as part of the Survey 200 project and NPP intensive monitoring project as a foci.  Ten to fifteen trees were assessed at each site for general tree health including canopy condition, canopy dieback and disease and pest problems.  Abiotic problems were also assessed including stress problems, nutrient deficiency symptoms, improper pruning practices, trunk damage and girdling.

"156","Modeling Urban Impervious Surface Areas in Relation to Urban Heat Island Effects","
<p>

  Introduction

</p>
<p>

  Vegetation influences urban environmental conditions and energy fluxes by selective reflection and absorption of solar radiation (Gallo et al, 1993) and by function of evapotranspiration (Owen et al, 1998). The presence and abundance of vegetation in urban areas has long been recognized as a strong influence on energy demand and development of the urban heat island (Oke, 1982; Huang et. al., 1987; Grossman-Clarke et al., 2005). Urban vegetation abundance may also influence air quality and human health (Wagrowski and Hites, 1997) because trees make their own food from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, sunlight, water, and a little amount of soil elements, and release oxygen in the process.   They also provide surface area for sequestration of particulate matter and ozone. The loss of trees in our urban areas not only intensifies the urban heat island effect due to the loss of shade and evaporation, but we lose a principal absorber of carbon dioxide and trapper of other pollutant as well. A noticeable phenomenon that has arisen as a result of urbanization is that urban climates are warmer and more polluted than their rural environments (Lo et al., 1997; Weng, 2001; Lo and Quattrochi, 2003).

</p>
<p>

  Urban development increases the amount of impervious surfaces in watersheds as farmland, forests, shrubs, rangeland, and meadows are converted into buildings, driveways, sidewalks, roads, and parking lots with virtually no ability to absorb storm water. The modification of the urban landscape influences the local (microscale), mesoscale, and even the macroscale climate (Brazel et al., 2000; Quattrochi et al., 2000; Voogt and Oke, 2003).

</p>
<p>

  It is well documented that escalating urbanization results in increased amount of impervious surfaces (Brabec et. al., 2002) and it consequently augments the intensity, volume, temperature, and duration of storm water runoff (Booth and Reinfelt, 1993; Schueler, 1994; U.S. EPA, 1997). Urban storm water runoff may cause or contribute to water quality degradation by changing natural hydrologic patterns (Driver and Troutman 1989), accelerating natural stream flows (Booth and Jackson, 1997), increasing stream bank erosion (May et., al., 1997), destroying aquatic habitat (Booth and Reinelt, 1993; Horner et. al., 1997), degrading stream water quality (Schueler, 1994; Booth and Jackson, 1997; May, et. al., 1997), increasing temperature (Galli, 1990), and elevating pollutant concentrations and loadings (Brabec et. al., 2002; Boyer et. al., 2002; Roy et. al., 2003).

</p>
<p>

  Impervious surfaces, particularly tar roads and parking lots, are generally dark, and hence, they increase the temperature of the rainwater as it reaches (Frazer, 2005). On the other hand, impervious areas have higher thermal conductivity than vegetated covers. Urbanization alters the natural ways energy flows through the atmosphere, land, and water systems (Lo and Quattrochi, 2003). For example, the temperature trend for Phoenix demonstrates a 5.5°C increase in the minimum temperatures from the late 1940s to present due to rapid expansion of urban areas (Balling and Brazel 1987, Brazel et al. 2000). Another concern that is not yet well documented is the impacts of pollutants released into stormwater runoff by building and paving materials themselves. For example, asphalt contains coal tar pitch, a recognized human carcinogen, as well as polycyclic aromatic carbons including benzopyrene, another carcinogen. Another potential source of pollutants is wood used for building structures that is normally treated with chromated copper arsenate, pentachlorophenol, or creosote (Frazer, 2005). Impervious surfaces are one of the key indicators of urban growth that can be directly quantified (Arnold and Gibbons, 1996; Brabec et. al., 2002). With the advent of urban sprawl, impervious surfaces have become a key parameter to be considered in urban growth and sprawl management because of their impacts on habitat health (Arnold and Gibbons, 1996). Hence, identification of the location, percent distribution, and growth of impervious surfaces in an urban suburban environment is an important step towards effective decision making for urban planning and overall watershed management. The goal of this study is to improve our understanding of the role of imperviousness in augmenting urban heat island effects in an arid environment. I have set the following objectives to achieve this goal.

</p>
<p>

  

</p>
<p>

  Objectives and Hypothesis

</p>
<p>

  To formulate better management plans for community growth and to understand the urban heat island effect in a desert environment I seek to answer the following questions.

</p>
<p>

  (1)    What are the percent distributions of impervious surface areas in different urban land-use and land-cover classes in the Phoenix metropolitan area?

</p>
<p>

  (2)    How are impervious surface areas related to the urban heat island effect?

</p>
<p>

  (3)    How the rate of expansion of impervious areas is related to that of the mean or minimum urban temperature?

</p>
<p>

  

</p>
<p>

  I propose to answer the above research questions by performing in-depth scientific analysis using geospatio-temporal analysis and modeling techniques with remotely sensed data, GIS data, biophysical data, and in-situ measurements. The overall goal of the proposed research is to improve our understanding of the role of impervious areas in relation to urban heat island effect in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The following objectives have been set to achieve this goal.

</p>
<p>

  

</p>
<p>

  (1)    Determine the most effective method (e.g., spectral mixture model, decision tree classifier, multiple regression, Imagine background removal approach) that identifies impervious surface areas at sub-pixel level accurately,

</p>
<p>

  (2)    Compute the mean percent distribution of impervious areas in different land use and land cover classes (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial, desert, agriculture),

</p>
<p>

  (3)    Determine the rate of expansion of impervious surface areas over different time period between 1985 and 2005, and

</p>
<p>

  (4)    Examine if urban temperature increases proportionately with the rate of expansion of impervious surface areas.

</p>
<p>

  

</p>
<p>

  I propose to test the following hypotheses to determine the objectives:

</p>
<p>

  (1)    There is a significant correlation between percent distribution of impervious surface areas and the urban heat island effect, and

</p>
<p>

  (2)    There is a significant correlation between rate of expansion of impervious surface areas and rate of change of mean or minimum temperature.

</p>
<p>

  

</p>
<p>

  Study Area and Data

</p>
<p>

  Landsat TM and ETM+ image data at 30 m spatial resolution with 7 channels acquired over the Phoenix metropolitan area in 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005 will be used to quantify varying amounts and distributions of impervious surface areas. I selected Landsat TM as the primary data for the proposed research since this is the only remotely sensed data with multispectral bands ranging from blue visible to thermal infrared that covers the longest time period starting from 1982. The selected study area covers most of the urban/suburban land-use and land-cover classes: residential, commercial, industrial, wild grass, woodlands, man-made grass, riparian vegetation, river, sandbars, and exposed soil. To assess the accuracy of the percent distribution of impervious areas identified by the sub-pixel analysis rules employed in the study, Quickbird 1-m or IKONOS 4-meter spatial resolution multispectral image with 4 channels -- blue (0.45 -- 0.52 ?m), green (0.52 -- 0.60 ?m), red (0.63 -- 0.69 ?m), and near infrared (0.76 -- 0.90 ?m) with the aid of USGS Digital Orthophoto Quads (DOQs) will be used. Both IKONOS and Landsat ETM+ data will be orthorectified and registered together to minimize the positional errors. Several field verifications will also be carried out to supplement the identification of land cover classes accurately. I will also use the land-use and land-cover inventory conducted by a team of researchers at 204 sample points (30m x 30m) located randomly using a tessellation-stratified dual-density sampling design (Extensive Survey Field Data Collection, Central Arizona -- Phoenix Long-term Ecological Research / CAP LTER).

</p>
<p>

  

</p>
<p>

  Sub-pixel Analysis

</p>
<p>

  Since the traditional hard classifier can label each pixel only with one class, urban imperviousness (e.g., roads) can only be recorded as either present or absent. Information on the percentage distribution of spatially mixed spectral signatures from different ground-cover features is not possible with the per-pixel classifiers (hard classifiers). Hence, the traditional classification of mixed pixels may lead to information loss (Wang, 1990), degradation of classification accuracy, and degradation of modeling quality in successive applications (Ji and Jensen, 1996 and 1999).

</p>
<p>

  The sub-pixel analysis that can provide the relative abundance of surface materials within a pixel may be a potential solution to per-pixel classifiers especially when dealing with medium to coarse spatial resolution satellite sensor images (e.g., Landsat Thematic Mapper -- Landsat TM; Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer -- MODIS; Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer - AVHRR). There have been several approaches to sub-pixel analysis -- linear mixture models (Smith et al., 1990; Settle and Drake, 1993; Van der Meer, 1997; Wu and Murray, 2003; Rashed, et al., 2003), Bayesian probabilities (Wang, 1990a; Wang, 1990b; Foody et al., 1992; Eastman and Laney, 2002; Hung and Ridd, 2002), neural network (Foody and Aurora, 1996; Zhang and Foody, 2001); fuzzy c-means methods (Fisher and Pathirana, 1990; Foody and Cox, 1994; Foody 2000), multivariate statistical analysis (Yang and Liu, 2005), and fuzzy set possibilities (Eastman, 1999). However, under real-world condition, the success of the above sub-pixel classification techniques can be slightly variable and may not be easily controlled. The approaches need to be handled carefully with the awareness of the limitations and uncertainties reported in Myint (2006).

</p>
<p>

  I will examine Imagine sub-pixel analysis based on the concept reported by Schowengerdt (1995) that the spectral reflectance of the majority of the pixels in remotely sensed image data is assumed to be a spatial average of spectral signatures from two or more surface categories. I will also develop linear spectral models (Wu and Murray, 2003; Rashed, et al., 2003) and multivariate regression models (Yang and Liu, 2005), and employ a supervised decision tree classifier based on a univariate decision tree (Quinlan, 1993) algorithm. The decision tree algorithm relies on hierarchical classifiers that predict class membership by recursively partitioning the data set into more homogenous subsets based on the reduction of deviance. The decision tree  ruleset  will be generated using commercial software See5 (HYPERLINK ""http://www.rulequest.com""). Classification will be performed using a See5 custom interface software program (developed under contract by Earthsat Corporation for USGS/EROS). The approach that gives the highest accuracy of all the above sub-pixel analysis techniques will be selected to perform identification of the percent impervious surface areas at sub-pixel level over the city of Phoenix in 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005. 

</p>
<p>

  

</p>
<p>

  Statistical Analysis Complementing the descriptive and exploratory data analysis of dependent and independent parameters, I will be testing the hypotheses set in the study. I will also examine classification and regression tree (Brienman et al., 1984; Ripley, 1996) algorithms to develop models for predicting thermal surface areas. The final results of using tree methods for classification or regression can be summarized in a series of (usually few) logical if-then conditions (tree nodes). Therefore, there is no implicit assumption that the underlying relationships between the predictor variables and the dependent variable are linear, follow some specific non-linear link function, or that they are even monotonic in nature. I will generate composite instance-based (nearest neighbor), rule-based models, and committees of models (Cubist, 2002) to estimate thermal plume.

</p>

</p>
<p>

  Significance of the project

</p>
<p>

  In general, there may be four primary qualities of imperviousness that make it an important indicator of urban environmental quality: (1) there is a strong relation between impervious surface and the hydrologic changes that degrade environmental quality, (2) an impervious surface is a key parameter of urbanization, (3) impervious surfaces obstructs natural pollutant processing in the soil by preventing percolation of water into the soil, (4) an impervious surface conveys pollutant loads into the receiving waters (Arnold and Gibbons, 1996; Brabec et. al., 2002). The National Water Quality Inventory (U.S. EPA, 1996) found urban runoff/discharges from storm sewers to be a major source of water quality impairment nationwide. Storm water pollution abatement has become a major concern both locally and at the national level and consequently has become a national priority.  

</p>
<p>

  The dynamics of urban impervious areas and its surrounding environments (i.e., forests, grasslands, agriculture, riparian vegetation, desert, water, etc.) are very important because the decisions that need to be made in planning smart growth include where to locate new residential areas, transportation infrastructure, new retailers, school catchment zones (Mesev, 2003), emergency management systems, industrial zones, public offices, commercial areas, how to reduce and monitor air pollution, noise pollution, water pollution, soil erosion, deforestation, land degradation, urban heat island effects, crime pattern and rate, disaster risk, and traffic congestion (Myint, 2006). Gober (2005) reports that metropolitan Phoenix is in the course of transforming one of the nation s largest metropolitan areas (largest impervious surface areas). 

</p>
<p>

  For the first time, the impervious surface area maps over the Phoenix metropolitan area for 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005 will be produced and archived as the baseline data at the Global Institute of Sustainability at Arizona State University and incorporated to 204 sample point database, Central Arizona -- Phoenix Long-term Ecological Research/CAP LTER) that can be used for subsequent analyses for interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research studies by many other researchers in many different research areas. The urban heat island effect is generally considered the most important challenge on the current environmental issue of Phoenix as it is surrounded by mountain ranges that trap warm air, and has experienced high degrees of conversion of natural to built materials (Gammage, 1999). It is important to note that the city is expanding at an alarming rate in a desert environment. Gober (2006) also reports that Phoenix urban area is approximately half the size of Los Angeles, but Phoenix has a population (~3 million) four times smaller than that of Los Angeles (~12 million). There is an emerging need to identify percent imperviousness at sub-pixel level in the city of Phoenix over different time period and explore its relationship with urban heat island effect within and around the city. The proposed plan will not only determine the percent distribution of impervious areas but also examine the rate of change of impervious surface areas in Phoenix over different time period between 1985 and 2005. The research study will also explore the mean percent distribution of impervious surface areas in different land use and cover classes.

  Broader impact

</p>
<p>

  This proposed research will contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of impervious surface area in relation to the urban heat island effect. This will also let us examine if urban temperature increases proportionately with the rate of expansion of impervious surface areas. The results and findings from this research will help us formulate better decisions for the smart growth in desert cities. The approaches in relation to sub-pixel analysis developed in this plan and results/findings from these approaches can also provide a lot of opportunities for other remote sensing applications. The proposed activities under this plan emphasize incorporating materials and methods from the research components of this plan in the Advanced Digital Analysis of Remotely Sensed Data course.

</p>
<p>

  At least two manuscripts resulting from the proposed project, which will report on the effectiveness of different sub-pixel techniques and findings on the role of impervious areas in relation to the urban heat island effect in the Phoenix metropolitan area will be published in peer reviewed journals.

"157","Linking aboveground and belowground processes of a common plant in urban landscapes","
<p>

  We propose a full year RA for one graduate student to assist in observations and experiments that link above and below ground processes, focusing on varying landscape manipulations at North Desert Village (NDV). We will focus on brittlebush (Encelia farinosa), a common and native Sonoran desert plant, that is also used commonly in both xeric and mesic landscapes throughout the CAP-LTER geographical region. The funds requested will support one of Hall s graduate students, Rachel Davies, and MS student and one of Faeth s, Laura Taylor-Taft, a PhD student. Support will be split among the two, either by semester or by ¼ time for each student. Both students are already involved in the proposed research. The proposed research will form at least part of each student s thesis or dissertation.

</p>
<p>

  
<b>I. Background</b>


</p>
<p>

  Aboveground and belowground components interact to influence community and ecosystem processes and properties in all terrestrial ecosystems (Wardle et al. 2005 Bardgett et al. 2005).Linking below-ground and above ground patterns and processes is a challenging, but vital, task because aboveground and belowground processes often control ecosystem properties and function (e.g., Wardle 2002), as well as community properties such as trophic structure and biodiversity (Ritchie et al. 1998). The links between plants, soil processes and biological organisms may be surprisingly specific, with both positive and negative feedbacks (e.g.,Wardle et al. 2005). Furthermore, the relationships between belowground and aboveground processes typically vary across a range of temporal and spatial hierarchies (Bardgett et al. 2005) and with large scale global changes, such as temperature (Wardle et al. 2005). We should also expect that aboveground and belowground processes vary greatly with human activities, especially urbanization and landscape practices, where both resources and biotic communities are greatly altered (e.g., Faeth et al. 2005). However, to our knowledge, there have not been experiments to elucidate the links between belowground processes and aboveground food webs in human-constructed, urban landscapes.

</p>
<p>

  We propose an RA to begin a project at NDV to link belowground processes to aboveground changes in biodiversity and food web dynamics for the arthropod communities associated with a native and common landscape plant, brittlebush. In turn, we will examine the feedback of changes in arthropod communities on belowground processes, thus linking the components.

</p>
<p>

  
<b>II. Belowground ecosystem processes: nutrient fluxes and decomposition</b>


</p>
<p>

  The RA will continue to monitor established and initiate new plantings of brittlebush at NDV in the xeric native, xeric-non native, mesic and oasis landscapes at NDV. Both the xeric native and non-native landscapes have some brittlebush. Our goal is to have at least 6 plants in each of the four landscape types, with 1-2 plants in the common areas and 4-6 plants across the 6 yards (one per yard) of each treatment. The RA will measure pools of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in all treatments (oasis, mesic, native, xeric ) and the fluxes of these elements between plants, soils, and the atmosphere. In particular, we are interested in understanding the interacting feedbacks between plant growth, physiology, chemistry and environmental factors that vary considerably between landscape types, including water availability, microclimate, and nutrient cycling in soils. We believe that to best compare plant-soil-atmosphere interactions between treatments, a common plant species should be used in all plots to eliminate species-specific differences. Thus we will use brittlebush, Encelia farinosa, because of the wealth of physiological and ecological data that have been published on this species and the background knowledge of arthropod communities in the CAP LTER (Faeth et al. 2005).

</p>
<p>

  
<b>III. Linking belowground processes to biodiversity, food web dynamics and trophic structure</b>


</p>
<p>

  Previous investigations within the larger CAP-LTER regional show that food web structure and dynamics are radically altered in urban mesic and urban desert remnants relative to outlying deserts. These studies involved a native Sonoran desert plant, brittlebush, where avian predators (top-down) and water resources (bottom-up) factors were manipulated. Our basic results show that 1) species diversity is reduced and species composition is altered in urban habitats, 2) desert remnants behave, in terms of seasonality and arthropod abundances, and response to top-down and bottom-up forces, more like mesic yards than their outlying desert counterparts, 3) predation become a more important force in urban habitats, presumably because of higher and more stable abundances of avian predators throughout the year. In short, our experiments, the first of their kind in urban environments, indicate that urbanization dramatically alters the structure and dynamics of food webs. Because all species interact within food webs, understanding these changes is critical to management of habitats, species diversity, and invasive species in rapidly expanding urban areas.

</p>
<p>

  NDV presents a unique opportunity to expand these studies at a different spatial scale -- that of the neighborhood within a given locality, as opposed to our previous and ongoing studies at the regional scale, and to connect our aboveground patterns with belowground processes. Our basic question is: does local neighborhood landscaping practices and associated changes in belowground processes alter biodiversity and food web structure and function of aboveground arthropods? To address this question, we will use the common and native brittlebush plant as the focal resource base for arthropod communities. We already have a large taxonomic database amassed for the myriad species associated with brittlebush. This is no small feat for arthropods associated with any given native plant.

</p>
<p>

  The RA will sample arthropods monthly from the same brittlebush plants used for the belowground studies. In addition, we monitor herbivory damage monthly by monitoring the amount of leaf damage on randomly selected branches and leaves of each plant. Arthropod samples will be collected monthly via sweep nets or with a vortex vacuum sampler (available in Faeth s lab). Samples will then be sorted, arthropod specimens will be counted, individuals will identified to at least family (for many of the arthropods on brittlebush, we know the genus and species identity), and then assigned trophic guild (i.e., herbivore, predator, parasite, detrivore, omnivore). The RA will also measure length and width of a subsample of each taxon group, which can then be related to biomass by previously published studies. Thus, we can then compare diversity (measured by species richness and evenness, and compared by rarefaction) and abundances (both by numbers and biomass) of each feeding guild and compare across landscapes types. Most importantly, we can relate overall biodiversity and trophic structure to specific pools of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus to specific plants both within and among landscape treatment types. We can also determine how above-ground processes, such as herbivory, feedback to influence belowground processes. For example, we might expect landscapes with more watering to reduce the levels of secondary compounds, which increases the levels of damage by chewing herbivores, which in turn increases litter fall and decomposition, and alters soil chemistry. We can also make comparisons of changes in food web structure and dynamics with naturally growing brittlebush at outlying desert sites and remnants because these sites will included in Rachel Davies and Laura Taft-Taylors thesis and dissertation projects.

</p>
<p>

  
<b>IV. Practical Matters</b>


</p>
<p>

  For this study, the minimum number of brittlebush plants required in each of the four treatments as 6 (or 24 total). We will not implement any treatments other than currently at NDV. These 6 plants can be planted in either the yards or the common areas, whichever is most practical, since we believe the scale of individual yards is likely irrelevant for this study. We have met with Scott Sisson and Chris Martin, and the memorandum of agreement will include brittlebush plantings and sampling as described. The RA will continue plantings, and begin monitoring the aboveground and below ground parameters we described above.

</p>
<p>

  
<b>V. Summary</b>


</p>
<p>

  The proposed RA is critical to initiating and completing this study of linking aboveground and below ground processes at NDV. We believe this study is novel and exciting, because, to our knowledge no other studies have linked belowground ecosystem level processes with aboveground community patterns and processes in human-constructed and urban landscapes.

"159","Drought and water conservation policy in the arid metropolitan Southwest: A geographic and historical assessment","
<p>

  The LTER research assistant
will develop a typology of water conservation efforts in the CAP study area, while applying this typology to a historical assessment of the development of water conservation policy in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area as well as a modern geography of conservation efforts in the region. The typology will further understanding of current policy efforts aimed at reducing regional water demand through regulatory, incentive- and information-based, and other approaches. The result will be a timeline documenting various water conservation policies and strategies, which will be evaluated in relation to the history of drought from existing hydroclimatic information. An analysis of the evolution of water conservation policy over the three consecutive management plans for the Phoenix Active Management Area, established by the Arizona Groundwater Management Act in 1980, will be undertaken to document the evolution of conservation policy at the regional and state level. In addition, information on water conservation policies and programs across municipalities will be evaluated in the context of the policy typology as well as the historical development of various conservation programs. This information will advance water resource decision-making and provide information necessary to understanding beliefs, attitudes and behavior related to the management of critical water resources. The research undertaken by the RA will also support the planned social survey of attitudes toward current and planned water policies and related matters, as articulated in the CAP-LTER II proposal (Section 2 ?? 14).

</p>

","

  Archival research and content analysis of policy documents will be undertaken to develop a narrative history of modern water conservation efforts in the region, with particular focus on the decade preceding and time following the passage of the Arizona Groundwater Management Act in 1980. A timeline documenting the development of state-regional conservation efforts within the City of Phoenix and the Active Management Area will be developed in relation to existing information about drought and related hydroclimatic information. Content analysis of municipal web pages and policy documents as well as interviews with conservation and other water specialists will be used to create geographic maps of regional conservation efforts in terms of the extensiveness of residential conservation programs and the incorporation of various policy tools to reduce water demand. The information compiled will be evaluated to assess periods of greater or lesser attention to conservation, shifts in the types of policy tools used to reduce water demand over time, and geographic patterns in conservation policy within the greater metropolitan region.

"160","Analysis and Publication of PASS and NDV Social Survey Research","
<p>

  One month of summer salary for 2006 will support my time in analyzing and publishing results of surveys conducted for the North Desert Village (NDV) and Phoenix Area Social Survey (PASS) projects. A collaborative paper is planned to disseminate findings of a comparative analysis of residential landscape preferences from the NDV and PASS (round one) surveys (with Yabiku, Cassagrande, Harlan and others). Preliminary findings and the conceptual framework for the qualitative analysis were presented in a poster that I co-authored at the CAP-LTER Symposium in January. The central research questions are: What residential landscape types are most preferred for front versus back yards, and why? To what degree are household yard preferences indicative of utilitarian, aesthetic, environmental, social or other values people attach to residential landscapes?

</p>
<p>

  With round two surveys planned for both PASS and NDV this spring into summer, I will spend substantial time with both projects in the analysis of write-up of results. As the chair of the PASS water sub-committee, papers on at least a couple of topics are planned ?? one investigating predictors of outdoor water use with an adapted conceptual model that includes behavioral beliefs, social norms and pressures, environmental values and sociodemographics as explanatory factors, and a second paper analyzing dimensionality in environmental perceptions and attitudes regarding the four PASS domains (water, sprawl, air quality, urban heat island) in terms of attribution of problems to natural versus human causes and orientation (or not) toward regulatory, technological, economic and other approaches to mitigating environmental problems.

</p>
<p>

  In addition to working on the above publications, I will spend time over the summer collaborating with LTER scientists on other projects aimed at understanding
Water Supply and Delivery, Riparian Restoration, and Resilience and Institutions as well as other CAP-LTER areas. Particular focus will be placed on furthering the 
 by planning for research activities in the 2006-7 academic year (see additional request for RA).

</p>

","
<p>

  The following techniques will be used to analyze survey results per the above research questions or objectives. First, qualitative analyses of comments regarding landscape preferences from both NDV and PASS I are being analyzed along with descriptive statistics that document preferences for front and back yard residential landscapes. Second, regression analyses will be used to assess critical factors that explain outdoor water use among residents in the CAP-LTER region. Third, factor and correlation analyses and descriptive statistics will assist in understanding perceptions of environmental problems and attitudes toward approaches to mitigating them. All papers will be written in teams including Sharon Harlan, Scott Yabiku, Dave White and David Cassagrande, among others.

"163","The behavior, ecology and evolution of the Western black widow (Latrodectus hesperus):  from desert predators to urban pests","
<p>

  The bite of a widow spider (
Theridiidae) has long been considered to be the most painful and dangerous of all North American spiders.  One result of urban expansion into desert habitats is that humans are encountering widow spiders more and more frequently.  Indeed, in Western cities such as Tucson and Phoenix, the local widow species, 
is so common in and around homes that many residents, particularly those with small children, have begun contracting with pest control agencies to spray for widow spiders.  Despite the fact that many pesticides are currently labeled for use against spiders, pesticides are, in fact, largely ineffective at killing web-building spiders such as widows.  This is because widow spiders rarely leaves their web and thus does not come into contact with toxins sprayed indiscriminately.  

</p>
<p>

  The combination of a rise in widow population numbers in and around human homes and the ineffectiveness and dangers of widespread pesticide use to combat widow spiders suggest that it is of paramount importance to develop an alternative approach to controlling the abundance of these spiders in urban habitats.  The above-stated problem can be addressed in a similar manner to that of biological invasions by non-native, introduced species.  
can be thought of as a novel species introduced somewhat suddenly to urban habitat in the West.  Thus, we can attempt to control the proliferation of widows in urban habitats in many of the same ways that we attempt to control the spread and establishment of invasive species.  

</p>
<p>

  The aim of this project is to develop a thorough understanding of the interaction between widow behavior and population ecology that results in colonization and population establishment/growth in urban habitats.  
  What behavioral differences have arisen between these relatively recently diverged populations?  For example, are spiders from urban environments, on average, bolder or shyer towards predators than spiders from desert habitats?  Is this boldness the result of different predation regimes experienced across the population types?  In other words, does the interaction between behavior (e.g. boldness towards predators) and ecology (e.g. degree of predation risk) explain the explosive success of urban widow spiders?  Similar questions will be asked regarding population differences in the behavioral ecology surrounding foraging, mating, agonism and parental care.  

</p>
<p>

  Finally, what can genetic variation within and between these populations tell us about the success of urban populations?  The study of non-native species introductions has emphasized the importance of reduced genetic variation that typically accompanies the colonization of new habitats by only a few introduced individuals.  Do urban populations show evidence of low levels of genetic variation similar to that predicted for invasive species?  If so, this may explain local adaptation to urban environments.  

</p>

<p>

  1.'Sampling- We have already begun establishing suitable study/collection sites for each of the habitat types. We are searching for sites that have a suitable number of spiders and that represent the habitat type well.Â  Once a site has been selected for study, we will formally document spider abundance, resource availability (web-sites, prey, refuge) and predation risk.Â  Population abundance will be estimated by the number of females on webs per square meter.Â  Prey abundance and diversity will be censused through standard entomological methods (e.g. sticky traps, pitfall traps).Â  We will rely upon field observations to determine the major predators on widows in each of the distinct habitat types.Â  In urban habitats, humans are almost certainly the most important and abundant predator.Â  In desert settings, however, we will document the occurrence of natural enemies: rodents, spiders, and wasp parasites.Â  We expect to find substantial differences between human-disturbed habitats and deserts in many of these variables, and will quantify differences with statistical analyses approporiate to the data.

</p>
<p>

  Â 

</p>
<p>

  2.Â  Behavior- We want to know whether aggression is correlated across disparate contexts.Â  A subset of spiders collected (nâ?¥60 per population) will be taken to the laboratory and studied through the remainder of their life cycle.Â  Spiders will be weighed to the nearest milligram and digitally imaged to measure carapace area.Â  Condition will be calculated as carapace area/body mass (Jakob 
1996).Â  Focal spiders will be housed individually in transparent, plastic boxes (10 x 10 x 12 cm.) equipped with a corner refuge.Â  Video trials described below will be conducted to quantify aggressive behavior in a number of contexts.Â  Data will later be gathered from videotapes using Noldus Observer software.Â  These rearing conditions and the behavioral protocol described below have been used to successfully study the Australian widow 


</p>
<p>

  
trials will involve the introduction of a standardized prey item (e.g. cricket)
to the spider s container.Â  Aggression towards prey will be quantified as latency to attack following prey ensnarement in the web, duration of wrapping behavior, and latency to envenomation.Â  
trials will involve the introduction of a size-matched conspecific intruder into the focal spider s container.Â  In 
these trials have resulted in a broad range of outcomes including web sharing, avoidance behavior, vigorous battles over refugia, and cannibalism.Â  Cannibalism will be scored in the same manner as foraging trials.Â  Other agonistic interactions will be scored according to contest duration and the proportion of time that the focal spider successfully defends its web/refuge.Â  
trials will involve a standardized, large-amplitude web stimulus characteristic of human disturbance.Â  We will record the initial reaction as (1) drops from web, (2) retreats to refuge, or (3) remains in hunting posture (upside down in middle of web).Â  Following this we will record the latency to return to a foraging posture.Â  
trials will involve the introduction of a male to the web.Â  We will record the latency to courtship, pre-copulatory attacks, mounting/mating, and post-copulatory attacks.Â  To emphasize, documenting the existence of a BS requires that trials be conducted on the same individuals repeatedly (i.e. each individual assayed repeatedly in all contexts).Â  Following mating and offspring production, this protocol will be repeated on a subset of each female s offspring in order to estimate the heritability of behaviors and/or BS.Â  We will quantify BS with multi-variate correlations and the heritability of behaviors via parent/offspring regression.Â  Representatives from each sibship will be preserved for future work aimed at detecting levels of genetic variation within and among populations.Â  

</p>
<p>

  3.Â  Ecology â?? To bridge the gap between ecological studies at the behavioral level (e.g. Objective # 2) and studies at the population level, we will conduct a transplant experiment.Â  Spiders from both population types, of known behavioral phenotype (i.e. taken from sibships studied in objective # 2), will be introduced to outdoor enclosures that mimic either desert habitat or urban habitat.Â  â??Urbanâ? enclosures (i) will contain high densities of black widows (14 â??â??/enclosure), (ii) will be augmented with man-made structures (e.g. cinder blocks), which serve as excellent web-sites/refugia for widows (1 cinder block/ â??spider), and (iii) will receive a high level of prey (3 crickets/ â??spider/week).Â Â  In contrast, â??desertâ? enclosures will have a low spider density (6 â??spiders/enclosure), a low availability of web/refuge resources (1 cinder block/ 2 â??spiders), and a low prey availability (1 cricket/â??spider/week).Â  Each family reared in Objective # 2 will be represented only once per treatment to control for sibship differences.Â  Note:Â  Our survey of collection sites in Objective # 1 above will ultimately guide the precise design of these simulated habitats.Â Â  We will employ a 2x2 factorial design in which spiders reared from parents that were collected from desert populations will be introduced into either â??desertâ? enclosures 
 or â??urbanâ? 
.Â  Similarly, spiders originating from urban habitats will be introduced into either â??urbanâ? enclosures 
 or â??desertâ? enclosures 
.Â  

</p>
<p>

  Twelve identical enclosures (6x2x4 m) will be cleared of naturally occurring prey prior to the start of experiment.Â  Thus, with 4 treatments and 12 enclosures, 3 replicates of each treatment can be run simultaneously.Â  The experiment will run in 3 sequential blocks such that we obtain 9 replicates for each treatment group.Â  Enclosures will be made of shadecloth with the grounded portion buried into the soil to ensure that spiders cannot escape from the enclosure.Â  We will enter and exit through a portal that will otherwise be sealed with Velcro.Â  Spiders will be introduced to enclosures one week prior to the beginning of data gathering to allow for acclimation.Â  Each black widow will be uniquely paint-marked and introduced to an enclosure at the beginning of its final juvenile molt (2-3 weeks prior to adulthood).Â  When a juvenile female molts to adulthood, we will collect her exuvia from her web for measurement, record her date of adult molt, re-mark her, and return her to the web.Â  Introduction of all spiders and prey will occur from randomly assigned points to avoid systematic spatial biasing of spider/prey density.Â  Three times weekly we will census for web location, nearest-neighbor distances, foraging success (prey items stored in web), and mortality.Â  We will assume a spider has died if we are unable to find it in three consecutive censuses.Â  Spiders will be weighed to the nearest milligram weekly throughout the experiment.Â  Â Â 

</p>
<p>

  In addition to the above censuses, we will conduct weekly staged encounters (foraging, agonism, human disturbance) that mimic laboratory assays (see above) and determine whether BS documented in the laboratory apply to a field setting.Â  We can then measure the ecological costs and benefits (e.g. time to reproduction, fecundity etc.) of each phenotype.Â  Note, however, that prey (crickets or conspecific competitors) killed during staged encounters will be removed from the web so that field measures (e.g. fecundity) are not influenced by staged feedings.Â  Because our focus is on female behavior and ecology, we will keep the number of male widows constant across treatments (1â??/â??).Â  Egg sacs will be removed 3 weeks after production (~ 1 week before hatching) and fecundity will be measured in the laboratory as the number of emergent offspring.Â Â  

</p>
<p>

  We predict that within the obvious expectation of slower development and reduced fecundity for spiders experiencing high levels of intraspecific competition and limited resources (i.e. spiders in â??desert â??enclosures), we will find that some phenotypes do better than others in such a regime.Â  As suggested before, perhaps a BS of low aggression is beneficial when agonistic encounters with conspecifics are common.Â  Alternatively, spiders may do best to exhibit the context-specific ability to decouple behavior such that they are timid in dangerous interactions with competitors, but aggressive in less dangerous interactions with prey.Â  If spider populations are locally adapted to their habitat of origin, then spiders from treatments 1 and 3 (DD and UU) should fare better than spiders introduced to a foreign habitat (treatments 2 and 4, DU and UD).Â  However, if we are able to document behavioral types for each sibship within population-level syndromes, then we may be able to predict, for example, which desert sibship will fare best in an urban enclosure, and which urban sibship will fare best in a Desert enclosure.Â  Disentangling the dynamic interaction between the behavior and population ecology of black widows will greatly improve our ability to understand (and potentially control) the establishment and spread of black widows in the CAP region.Â

"165","Monitoring Human-Environment Interactions in a Controlled Landscaping Experiment--Summer 2006","
<p>

  
<b>1) A general description of the project(s) the RA will work on, including where it fits into the overall plans for the IPA.</b>


</p>
<p>

  Our project is titled ""Monitoring Human-Environment Interactions in a Controlled Landscaping Experiment.""  This project is the social science component of CAP-LTER s landscaping experiment at North Desert Village (NDV) on the ASU East Campus.  Initial funding for this project was provided by a pilot grant from the College of Liberal Arts (PI Scott Yabiku, other investigators were Patricia Gober, David Casagrande, Charles Redman, Nancy Grimm, Elizabeth Wentz, and Sharon Harlan), and later support has come from CAP-LTER.  The aim of this project is to study the reciprocal relationships between humans and their immediate residential environment.

</p>
<p>

  This project fits into the human control of biodiversity IPA in that it is a prime way in which human-environmental feedbacks are closely monitored.  Although extensive human measurement is happening in other parts of CAP-LTER, such as the PASS survey, our NDV project aims to monitor human behavior in as tightly a controlled experimental setting as possible.  Thus the NDV social measurement has unique strengths not found in other LTER projects.

</p>
<p>

  
<b>2) Specific duties of the RA during Summer 2006</b>


</p>
<p>

  a) The main goal for Liz in Summer 2006 is to finish the post-treatment surveys at NDV.  From past experience, we have learned that the first 30% of interviews come easy, the next 40% come after some effort, and the last 10-30% can be very difficult to ""mop up""??e.g., some people are hardly ever at home, some people aren t at their homes even though Liz scheduled an interview for the time, some people need to be contacted via an alternative survey mode (self-administered paper survey).  Thus while we will probably finish 50-75% of the interviews by the end of this semester, there will likely be some remaining hard cases to get, which we hope to do in the summer.

</p>
<p>

  b) A secondary goal for Liz in Summer 2006 is data entry of the surveys.  First, we need to key in the survey responses from paper to computer-readable form.  Second, if there is time, we will begin to transcribe the open-ended sections of the interviews (open-ended questions are free-form responses and narratives that are not simple ""multiple choice"" type survey questions).  Transcription is a laborious process, yet it is necessary for doing qualitative and textual analysis of open-ended questions.

</p>
<p>

  c) Lastly, if time permits, Liz can help us in preparing manuscripts.  The ""in progress"" manuscript listed below in 5c will certainly be able to be sent off for review this summer if Liz is helping us; we should also be able to get a good start on some others.

"166","Exploring the effects of landscape treatment on soil nutrient cycling at the North Desert Village and across the CAP-LTER","
<p>

  Rates of urbanization and land conversion in the arid western US are among the highest nationally, with cities such as Las Vegas and Phoenix reaching to growth rates of 3% or higher over the last decade (US Census, 2000).  Although conversion to mesic landscaping with water-intensive turf grass is common, desert landscaping (xeriscape) is a popular, growing practice in residential yards of these cities for its perceived water-conservation and aesthetic benefits. Xeric landscapes are planted with native or non-native vegetation and are designed to look functionally similar to native desert ecosystems, but they are often intensively managed with year-round drip irrigation, raking and removal of aboveground litter, and seasonal pruning (Martin, 2001).  Furthermore, the restoration of urban desert landscapes often occurs on altered, homogenized soils that previously supported agriculture or became disturbed during the building process.  Restoration of desert landscapes in both urban and wildland settings has traditionally focused on the initiation and maintenance of native plant communities with the assumption that the presence of native plants will also restore ecosystem functioning (Young et al. 2005).  However, recent studies at the CAP-LTER have shown that restored desert landscapes of urban areas function more similarly to mesic lawns than native deserts with respect to herbivory and aboveground arthropod fauna (S. Faeth, personal communication). Less is known about the functioning of belowground processes in restored, xeric landscapes of the urban environment, but it is likely that management practices will play large roles in controlling the cycling of nutrients between plants, soils, and the atmosphere.

</p>
<p>

  The dynamics of nutrient cycling in undisturbed arid land ecosystems is characterized by heterogeneity across both spatial and temporal scales (Austin et al. 2004).  Spatially, nutrients and organic matter are distributed into ""resource islands"" below perennial shrubs where water, plant litter inputs, heterotrophic microbial activity, and horizontally-transported sediments are concentrated compared to between-plant interspaces (Schlesinger et al., 1996).  Nutrient availability, transformations, and loss in desert ecosystems are also controlled by the timing of water inputs which occur in pulse events of precipitation and overland flow followed by rapid drying (Welter et al. 2005).  We hypothesize that ""restored"" urban desert landscapes function fundamentally different than native desert ecosystems due to human alteration of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in belowground resource supply.  

</p>
<p>

  In collaboration with Stan Faeth and two graduate students  (Rachel Davies and Laura Taylor-Taft), I will identify five treatments at the NDV and across the CAP region within which I will measure soil-plant-atmosphere exchange of belowground resources, including water, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus.  Our primary treatments within the North Desert Village and urban core will include replicates sites of native desert remnant, ""restored"" native desert, and ""restored"" xeric (non-native) desert.  Additionally, we will measure nutrient cycling in mesic lawns and oasis landscapes at the NDV for comparison.  In each treatment, we will capture the spatial distribution of soil nutrients and transformations using transects that will run beneath plant canopies to the interspaces between shrubs.  Additionally, we will capture the importance of temporal water pulses by performing short-term water-addition experiments in the field and laboratory.  We will work primarily with the common Sonoran Desert plant, Encelia farinosa (Brittlebush) because of the wealth of information already collected on the physiology and community dynamics of this species.  To expand our results across plant functional types, however, we will also measure pools and fluxes in all treatments associated with a common Sonoran Desert N fixer, Palo Verde (Cercidium spp.).

  Allen and his PhD student, Daniel Gonzales, have worked on the development of techniques to measure these fluxes.  The most accurate and expensive method developed couples an aerosol mass spectrometer with micrometeorological measurements to determine speciated aerosol deposition directly.  In January 2005 we made these measurements at the Salt River Pima Maricopa Indian Community.  We have preliminary results from this experiment, but continue to analyze the ~5 GB of data collected during the 2-week experiment.  In order to increase the spatial and temporal coverage of flux measurements, we have been working on indirect flux measurement techniques to benefit the Ecosystem Response to Material Deposition from the Urban Atmosphere project and our understanding of biogeochemical cycling in the CAP-LTER study area.

  For the Ecosystem Response to Material Deposition from the Urban Atmosphere project we are developing a method to use micrometeorological and routine meteorological measurements to estimate deposition velocities using the technique of Slinn (1982).  Co??located filter bank measurements of gas- and particle-phase nutrient species will be used to measure pollutant concentrations.  The product of deposition velocity and nutrient concentration is the nutrient flux.  This technique does not directly measure deposition, but does estimate deposition in the same way as state-of-the-science air quality models using local meteorology and concentration measurements.  Using this simpler method we will monitor deposition at 3 locations in 3 one-month experiments for the Ecosystem Response to Material Deposition from the Urban Atmosphere project.  This technique can be applied to measure deposition in urban settings.

  In collaboration with Grimm and others we are developing a semi-quantitative indicator of deposition which will collect dryfall and throughfall on ion absorption resin beads.  A similar technique has been used by Fenn and Poth (2005) in the San Bernadino Mountains.  We have adapted this technique for the lower canopy height and drier conditions of the desert.  These deposition collectors will be deployed at 15 desert remnant sites, and may be used at other CAP-LTER sites for economical long term deposition monitoring.

  Revised Filter and Denuder Bank Ammonia Analysis Method

<p>

  During testing the filter and denuder banks in January 2005, it was found that the ammonia analysis on the Lachat flow injection analyzer was problematic due to interference of an unknown nature.  Several experiments were conducted to eliminate potential interference caused by sample pH and to determine the recovery of known concentration spikes from fresh samples.  Ultimately, it was determined that ammonia analysis should be done on the TrAAcs analyzer, which uses the same ammonia detection method, but adds a surfactant to each sample before analysis.  It was hypothesized that the surfactant removes the interfering compound, possibly an organic amine.

"173","Effects of the urban atmosphere on the structure and functioning of soil lichen communities","	<p>
		
  Tropospheric ozone (O
		<sub>3</sub>
		) and reactive nitrogen (N) in the urban atmosphere cause numerous, complex ecological consequences in ecosystems within and downwind of urban centers.  Previous studies in the northeastern and western US have shown that N deposition and long-term exposure to O
		<sub>3</sub>
		 can alter plant production, soil microbial processes, hydrologic and atmospheric N losses, and the biodiversity of lichen species (Aber et al. 1998, Fenn et al. 2003, Gregg et al. 2003, Sigal and Nash, 1983).  In many arid land ecosystems, lichens within cryptobiotic crust communities in soil are the dominant organisms responsible for N input to ecosystems from the atmosphere (Evans et al. 1999).  Land use changes typical of the intermountain west, including recreational traffic and grazing, are known to significantly alter cryptobiotic crust community structure and decrease the capacity of these organisms to fix N (Belnap, 2002). However, little is known about how these organisms may respond to urbanization, now the most rapidly expanding land use in the western US.  

	</p>
	<p>
		
  We propose to examine the community structure, physiology, and functioning of soil lichen and cyanolichen communities across a gradient of nitrogen deposition in the Phoenix metropolitan area (Baker et al. 2001).  We expect the abundance and species richness of soil lichens to be highest upwind of the city and lowest in the urban core and especially downwind of the city where ozone exposure is expected to be most concentrated.  Furthermore, we expect that nitrogen fixation capacity of soil crust communities will decline from upwind to downwind as lichens become physiologically damaged or as available nitrogen increases and thus inhibits the energy-intensive N-fixation process.  We will complement our gradient work with manipulative experiments in the field and laboratory to directly test the effects of N addition on rates of N fixation.

	</p>
	<p>
		
  We will sample lichen populations in 15 sites arrayed along a hypothesized gradient of N deposition, including 5 sites located to the west of the city (upwind), 5 sites in the urban center (core), and 5 sites located to the east of the metropolitan area (downwind).  These sites were established earlier this year as the primary design for an NSF funded project to examine ecosystem responses to the urban atmosphere (CNDep; Grimm, Hall, Kaye, and Allen).  In addition, we will explore nutrient limitation of N fixation by sample lichens within anticipated long-term plots that have been fertilized with N, P, and N x P earlier this year.  Ongoing work on the CNDep project will complement the proposed project, and includes measurements of aboveground net primary production, soil pools and transformations of available N and phosphorus (P), and resin/tower-based deposition measurements of ozone, carbon, and nitrogen.  Although the current RA proposal is for summer funding only, we anticipate that our research will occur over three seasons during 2006-07(pre-monsoon spring/summer, post-monsoon summer/fall, and winter) to accommodate seasonal changes in lichen physiology.

The ultimate goal of my research is to preserve native communities and species interactions in urban environments. The majority of published quantitative urban bird studies has examined correlations of habitat structure and avian biodiversity (e.g. Blair 1996, DeGraaf and Wentworth 1986). Though these studies are important to our overall understanding of community structure, they do not address the underlying mechanisms and driving factors of urban bird biodiversity. I will address these questions by testing foraging decisions using artificial food patches, along the urban rural gradient. I will build upon previous CAP LTER research where together with Eyal Shochat and colleagues (2004), we supported the established trend in urban bird community structure of high densities but low diversity. We identified potential mechanisms responsible for these trends and our research suggested that the lack of a perceived predation risk could have a major impact in shaping urban biodiversity for birds. I will work with 
 to address how predation shapes bird communities along the urban rural gradient. This research compliments Stan Faeth s CAP LTER brittlebush study and has the potential to provide a mechanism explaining the trophic dynamics at the plant-insect level, furthering our understanding of urban biodiversity. In addition to studying how foraging decisions vary along the gradient, I will utilize the CAP LTER bird survey data and address how different human-altered landscapes interact with community structure and foraging behavior. If particular landscape designs, i.e. those that mimic the native landscape such as a xeric design, support a higher level of bird diversity, then development plans could incorporate these designs in future projects.


</p>
<p>

  


</p>
<p>

  1.  In which human-made habitats along an urbanization gradient can we detect a shift in bird community structure?

</p>
<p>

  2.   Why does community structure vary along the gradient? I will compare the mechanistic responses of foraging behavior in relation to predation and competition.

</p>
<p>

  I will use the existing data from the 
<b>Survey 200</b>
 and the 
<b>Urban Parks</b>
 bird point counts to determine the bird community structure at 32 residential sites. During February 2006, I quantified the landscapes in private yards along a 150 m X 40 m transect at these 32 sites. I assigned yards as mesic, xeric or oasis, in addition to quantifying the height structure of the trees and bushes within the transect. I am now in the process of determining how bird community structure related to landscape design. This information will expand our understanding of the distribution of bird species along the gradient. 

</p>
<p>

  To appreciate why certain birds are able to persist within clearly defined parameters along the gradient, I will apply Optimal Foraging Theory (Charnov 1976, Brown 1988) and evaluate foraging decisions at artificial food patches. Optimal Foraging Theory accounts for the relationship between resource availability and species interactions. An individual behaving optimally is expected to quit harvesting a particular patch when the costs of foraging equal the gain (Brown 1988). Both predation and competition influence the cost-benefit relationship. Thus, focusing on behavioral aspects along the gradient provides insight into the mechanisms driving community structure (Bowers and Breland 1996). For example, a habitat with low predation risk will have a higher competition rate.
Foragers will experience fewer costs because of a lack of predation, but must be highly efficient foragers to out compete competitors.  

</p>
<p>

  To assess foraging behavior, I will place artificial food patches, trays consisting of 20 grams of millet seed mixed into 3 kg of sand, along the urban gradient.  Assuming that bushes and trees provide protection from predators (Shochat et al. 2004), one tray will be placed close to a bush and the other tray out in the open, 3 meters from vegetation at each study site. I will measure the amount of seed remaining in the trays after 24 h. This measurement is the Giving Up Density (GUD) which quantifies a forager s perception of costs and risks associated with a patch, as well as the quality of the habitat (Brown 1988). Measuring GUDs to assess habitat quality and community structure is an established technique in ecology studies yet very few urban studies incorporated this method (but see Bowers and Breland 1996 and Shochat et al. 2004). In addition to observing the trays two hours before and after the commencement of each 24 h experiment, I will video tape the seed trays to determine which species are utilizing the trays. By comparing the differences in seed remaining in trays placed in bushes vs. those in the open settings, I will determine the level of a perceived predation risk at each site along the urban gradient.

</p>
<p>

  Shochat et al. (2004) demonstrated a significant difference in foraging behavior between urban and desert birds. By manipulating the placement of seed trays to test for predation effects, we found urban birds have a less perceived predation risk than their desert counterparts. The reason for these differences is presently unclear though the unnatural removal of top predators in urban settings could reduce the perceived predation risk (Faeth et al. 2005). Dr. Warren proposes to test this hypothesis by measuring foraging decisions while increasing the predation risk in urban settings. Simulating an increased predation risk might determine if a lack of experience with predators in urban settings is responsible for the lack of a perceived predation risk. I plan to work with Dr. Warren in addressing this question at the food patch locations. The currently proposed experiments will assist in developing the protocols for these future experiments on predation risk.

</p>
<p>

  


</p>
<p>

  I designed my experiments to test the hypothesis that the impacts of urbanization on bird community structure differ along the urban gradient and that certain human landscapes at moderate levels of urbanization will support remnant native bird communities. If this hypothesis is correct, then foraging behavior in patches that consist of desert (xeric) landscapes will more closely mimic the natural desert birds while foraging behavior in landscapes that lack the desert component (mesic), will behave like urban foragers. I predict:  

</p>
<p>

   


</p>
<p>

  1. Based on my prior work and other CAP LTER research, the urban core will show a low predation risk and be highly competitive (due to the increase of non-native species). The desert will have a high predation rate but lower competition with very few, if any non-native species. Residential yards with mesic landscapes will have a high predation risk but also high competition while residential yards with xeric landscapes will have low predation and low competition (Fig. 1). These trends will be supported
by the expected GUD measurements.

 ?? Expected GUDs along the urbanization gradient and in different landscape designs.

</p>
<p>

  3.  Predation effects will vary along the gradient and when predation risks are high, GUDs close to bushes (refuge from predators) will be lower than GUDs in the open (exposed to predators). Thus, GUDs will be higher at xeric residential sites but the differences between bush and open GUDs will be the same for mesic and xeric sites. 

</p>
<p>

  The combination of urban rural gradient analysis and quantification of human landscape designs will allow me to correlate which human-made habitats support native communities and species interactions. By performing experimental studies of avian foraging behavior, I will tease apart the factors and requirements needed to reverse the trends of declining biodiversity. The loss of biodiversity has both measurable and intrinsic value to human populations. The alteration of ecosystem processes ultimately jeopardizes clean air, safe drinking water, productive soils and climate (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). In addition, wildlife experiences greatly enhance well-being and exposure to nature provides opportunities for humans to understand natural ecosystems and ultimately, increase their sensitivity to ecological issues (Savard et al. 2000). If urbanites lose the connection with their natural environment, the ability to incorporate sound ecological initiatives into public policy diminishes and furthers the degradation of our natural environment.

</p>
<p>

  Assessing the impacts of urbanization and identifying the key mechanisms behind the general trends of high densities and low diversities provides a necessary scientific basis for sound management decisions that attempt to enhance urban biodiversity. Thus, my work will yield advances in both basic ecological understanding as well as options for future urban development that is livable for both people and native birds.
In addition, my proposed research addresses the link between the environment and the human urban experience. If native birds can no longer persist in urban areas due to a combination of habitat loss and the alteration of ecosystem functions, then we must question how these trends impact human health and the sustainability of urban environments.

</p>
<p>

  


</p>
<p>

  Due to the potential of linking the proposed study with Dr. Faeth s brittlebush experiments, the ideal time to conduct the research would be February and March 2007, the period when the insect population dynamics appear to be most strongly driven by the presence of birds. In addition, coordinating the research with ongoing bird counts conducted in Jan and Mar would greatly enhance data collection. This time frame fits within Dr. Warren s predation research.

  Introduction
</h1>
<p>

  I have developed a tri-trophic model describing population dynamics on a general plant system. In order to explore three classic community theories, the model needs more detailed parameters and accuracy. I want to develop this model further by including guilds of arthropods and an additional level of predators. After doing this, I will use the model to predict and explain outcomes from a current NSF project carried out by Stan Faeth and John Sabo, and CAP LTER bird-trophic level studies by Paige Warren and Eyal Shochat.  One of their overarching goals is to test empirically three classic community theories that predict how water availability and associated stress should limit the capacity of consumers to regulate plant biomass via limitations on plant productivity in urban ecosystems. These CAP-related projects are strictly experimental, so an ecological mathematical model will be a significant contribution and expansion.

</p>

<p>

  Trophic dynamics and energy supplies are closely linked, because energy limits ultimately the number of trophic levels in natural ecosystems. More important is 
 they are linked, and several theories have been developed. Variations of two predominant theories have been proposed, but the basics are usually the same: resource control (bottom-up) versus consumer control (top-down). Resource control occurs when resource availability is the key process. The theory predicts that the biomass of all trophic levels should increase with increasing productivity (Murdoch et al. 1998). Populations within the trophic level are affected predominantly by competition for resources, not predation (Begon et al. 1996). Consumer control theory anticipates that consumers exert control on the biomass of resources, creating negative feedbacks between increases in consumer biomass along productivity gradients and the biomass of resource populations (Hairston et al. 1960, Oksanen et al. 1981, Power 1992). While both these theories have been proved to be valid in different ecosystems under different conditions, they do not apply to all systems. A well recognized problem with the concepts of top-down and bottom-up control is that they are difficult to separate in practice, and in many situations some form of both theories is operative (Pace et al. 1999). Menge and Sutherland (1987) hypothesized that the relative effects of predation on species diversity vary as a function of environmental stress and productivity. This stress mediated control concept suggests that predation should be more important at low levels of stress, because higher stress limits the abundance of predators, more so than herbivores. Competition for resources is more important at low stress (and productivity) levels, and herbivores reduce plant biomass at intermediate levels.

  Faeth and Sabo are putting these theories into practice by manipulating water availability, and thereby stress level, to a common desert plant (Brittlebush, 
) along a desert-urban gradient, where water is a limiting factor. Preliminary results reveals significant effects of site on abundances and diversity of herbivores, predators, parasites and omnivores (Faeth et al. 2005). The findings suggest that consumer control, particularly by birds, may be more important in the human-dominated areas, and resource control is more important in surrounding desert areas. Herbivores are more abundant in treatments supplemented with water, while carnivores are not. This suggests that water stress, classically considered a resource, has an effect on top-down control. This result contradicts conventional ecological theory that higher resource abundances and reduced bird diversity, result in more bottom-up control of plant herbivores in urban areas. Top-down control of herbivores, albeit at higher densities, is paradoxically a consequence of lack of top-down control of birds, coupled with urban areas acting as refuges for selected bird species. These preliminary results suggest that urbanization creates subtle and unexpected shifts in trophic dynamics that are not readily predictable from studies of less human dominated systems. So far, these findings indicate a support for the stress mediated control hypothesis.

  By simplifying preliminary results into a mathematical model, these complex interactions can be explored in more depth. I have developed a simple, but promising mathematical model framework that can be improved and expanded to meet these expectations. So far the framework is a tri-trophic system based on biomass of plant, herbivores and predators, and the outcome is determined by various treatments of water. The model has been tested for stability and predicts both fluctuations and stable oscillations, depending on water treatment. The tested parameter values are chosen from what we might expect from this system; however they are not based on observed real data. The stability analysis shows that the model makes some biological sense by describing the functional dynamics between the three trophic levels; however the model also has some obvious flaws that must be adjusted for. First, to make it more applicable, exact biomass data are needed. Second, since there obviously is a fourth trophic level (birds), I will include this trophic level in the model. This has direct applicability to experimental studies now underway by Paige Warren. Third, to get a better understanding of the whole system, I want to look at different guilds living on the brittlebush, such as different herbivores (chewers, sap suckers, leaf miners), parasites, and different predators. These parameters should all be included in the model. 

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

  I hereby ask for funding for the proposed project. I will in collaboration with Marty Anderies work on the mathematical framework, and to parameterize the model, I will use data from Stan Faeth s preliminary experiments using biomass estimation for each guild. To create an estimate of brittlebush biomass, 20 plants will be measured (height, diameter, volume) and compared to dry mass, so that a biomass coefficient can be made. It will therefore be necessary to work on Stan Faeth s brittlebush sites to collect necessary field data in parallel with the modeling process. This could be combined with inviting students from the Ecology Explorers, to give them an idea of how a large scale field experiment is carried out. When the model is adequately accurate, I will perform simulated experiments testing the three ecosystem theories described earlier.

<p>

  


</p>
<p>

  I see this as a starting point for my PhD dissertation work. With a model like this, I can create a basis for further directions of experiments and studies, both in the field and laboratory. Note that the model development is not part of Faeth and Sabo s NSF grant, which is strictly experimental in nature. Thus, development of the model will add an additional dimension to their NSF research, but more importantly a new direction for understanding trophic dynamics in CAP LTER. As mentioned above, the Brittlebush project is currently attracting other collaborators as well, looking at below ground conditions (Sharon Hall and students) and effects on birds (Paige Warren and students). My model will be available for these groups and can be modified to facilitate their experiments if desired. This will eventually add to the increasing knowledge of urbanized ecosystems and our understanding of top-down, bottom-up theories as well as the effects of water stress on biomass and community structure.Â

  Work on this project will be carried out in conjunction with Stan Faeth and Marty Anderies.Â  Therefore, both Stan Faeth and Marty Anderies are my choices for CAP-LTER co-PI s of association.Â  I plan to be working directly with Stan and Marty on this project for at least 20 hrs each week throughout the summer of 2006, on a flexible schedule.Â  This grant will aid my ability to perform the research both this summer and further on into the 4 year future of my projects.Â  I will of course share any data with CAP-LTER.

"178","Plant Flowering Phenology in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area","
<p>

  


</p>
<p>

  Phenology is the seasonal timing of environment-mediated events such as growth and reproduction.  Phenology is quantified by determining time of onset and end of events, duration, and number of flowers (Augspurger 1983, Rathcke and Lacey 1985).  Studies of flowering and leafing phenology have dramatically increased during the last few decades due to growing concerns over global climate change (PeÃ±uelas and Filella 2001, Sparks and Menzel 2002, Walther et al. 2002, Badeck, et al. 2004) and because phenology is a highly sensitive indicator that researchers can use to study the effects of climate change at multiple scales (Chuine et al. 2000, Sparks and Menzel 2002, PeÃ±uelas et al. 2004, Williams and Abberton 2004).  Urban climatic conditions are considered similar to the changing global climate conditions; therefore, many researchers study urbanized areas as smaller scale experiments, or models, of global climate change (Ziska et al. 2003).  Concerns over climate change are not the only reasons for studying urban ecosystems.  It is important to create urban environments resilient to social, economic, and ecological collapse.

</p>
<p>

  The literature of flowering phenology in urban environments suggests that spring-blooming plants in urban environments located in temperate, Mediterranean, and boreal ecosystems in North America, Europe, and China tend to bloom earlier in the city than in the surrounding un-urbanized habitat (Roetzer et al. 2000, Fitter and Fitter 2002, White et al. 2002, Ziska et al. 2003, Zhang et al. 2004).  Moreover, non-woody plants, early spring bloomers, and insect-pollinated plants in these environments tend to be more sensitive than woody plants, mid- or late-spring bloomers, and wind-pollinated plants (Fitter and Fitter 2002, Traidl-Hoffman et al. 2003).  Finally, temperature (Heat Island Effect) has been assumed to be the cause of earlier flowering in the urban environments since the large-scale advancement of flowering has been strongly correlated with global warming.  

</p>
<p>

   Study of flowering phenology in urban ecosystems is important because changes in phenology may have wide-reaching consequences.  Explicit study of the potential consequences of any changes in flowering phenology in urbanized areas has not been widely addressed; however, general ecological consequences from phenological changes due to global climate change have been hypothesized and studied, such as earlier and extended pollen allergy season (e.g., Van Vliet et al. 2002, Traidl-Hoffman et al. 2003, Ziska et al. 2003) and mis-matches in synchronized inter-specific interactions (e.g., Kudo et al. 2004).  These effects of global climate change may be similar to changes and consequences in urban ecosystems.  Other potential consequences include effects on:  individual fitness (e.g. offspring production and viability); intra-specific interactions (e.g., genetic mixing); plant inter-specific interactions (e.g., resource competition); non-plant inter-specific interactions (e.g., pests, pollinators, pathogens, herbivores); economics (e.g., any agriculture occurring near or within cities, including the floral industry and crops that require pollination by native organisms; also, private gardens); and human health (e.g., pollinosis, psychological well-being/appeal).

  My proposed research will address the gap in knowledge in urban ecology presented above by:'observing an urban ecosystem in an arid region; studying an urban ecosystem at a finer spatial scale than has been done before; and explicitly addressing the effects of flowering phenology on plant fitness.

</p>
<p>

  Â The central question of my study is:Â  How does urbanization affect spatiotemporal pattern of flowering phenology in an arid environment at multiple scales?Â  This question is of significance because (1) while research demonstrates a difference between urbanized areas and their surrounding un-urbanized areas, no studies have been found that have observed spatiotemporal patterns within a city; (2) it is unknown, to the best of my knowledge, if cities in arid regions show similar responses of flowering phenology as cities in temperate regions; and (3) ecological, health, and economic repercussions of the spatiotemporal pattern of flowering are unclear.Â  To address my question, I will investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of flowering plants in the Phoenix metropolitan area (PMA) at two scales (local and regional) to determine their causes.Â  My research compliments the research currently being conducted on LULC, species composition, climate, nutrient cycling, and species interactions in the Phoenix metropolitan area.

</p>
<p>

  Â The central research question can be further divided into three specific questions:

</p>
<p>

  1.Â  Does land cover type affect the spatiotemporal flowering pattern in the Phoenix metropolitan area?

</p>
<p>

  2.Â  Do different microclimatic conditions in urban areas cause changes in spatiotemporal patterns of flowering?

</p>
<p>

  3.Â  What are the ecological and human health consequences of any changes in the spatiotemporal patterns of flowering?

</p>
<p>

  Â Â Â Â Â Â  The first objective, characterizing spatiotemporal patterns of flowering within the Phoenix metropolitan area, I have developed to address the first question and is the subject of my research through the summer.Â  I am describing the intra-annual spatiotemporal pattern of flowering of flora in the PMA by analyzing data from multiple sites (30 x 30 m) across the Phoenix metropolitan region.Â  Initial sampling sites consist of four land cover types (urban, residential xeric, residential mesic, and desert) and have 3 replicates.Â  The replicate sampling sites occur along an urban-rural gradient.Â  Â Observational data is collected by me from each site once a week and includes: identification of plants and whether they are blooming; intensity of blooming; duration of blooming; land cover type; % of impervious surface cover; distance to major roads; and distance to urban center, microclimate information (such as air temperature, soil moisture) with data loggers and probes.Â  Moreover, photographs of each site are taken on each data collection day.

  The Co-PI of the CAP LTER project with whom I will work is Dr. Jianguo Wu.Â  I will spend 20% of my time working with him as well as with Dr. Tony Brazel, who is interested in my work.Â  I expect to produce the following:Â  (1) data from each of my sites (as described above) and (2) data analysis for a manuscript for publication or presentation.Â  I agree to provide the CAP-LTER Data Manager with the data I gather.

"179","Nitrogen Fertilization Effects on Roadside Plant Growth: A Greenhouse Seedbank Experiment","
<h1>
  Project Description
</h1>
<p>

  I propose to conduct an experiment on the effects of anthropogenic nitrogen fertilization on roadside plant communities in the Sonoran desert.  This experiment will extend my research on the migration of plant species along freeway corridors in the Phoenix metropolitan area.  Plant migration in this context includes the movement of both native and non-native species, and will allow me to make inferences regarding future potentially significant invasive plants. 

</p>

","
<p>

  


</p>
<p>

  Research in many areas has shown that the verges of roads and freeways in arid lands have higher water and nutrient availability than the surrounding undeveloped land (Forman 2003); this was demonstrated for the Phoenix area in the CAP LTER 200 point survey (Hope 
. in press).  Other studies have shown that roadside and freeway verges operate as reserves for plant species that have otherwise become rare (Tikka 
. 2000, Tikka 
. 2001) and as conduits for the spread of non-native species (Wilcox 1989, Tyser and Worley 1992, Forman 2003, Gelbard and Belnap 2003).'For example, there is anecdotal evidence that Highway 8 served as the conduit for the movement of Sahara mustard (
) from California to Arizona, and that in a subsequent high rainfall year, the plant was able to greatly expand its range from the roadsides out into the SonoranDesert (Tellman 2002).Â  It is now considered one of the greatest threats to the SonoranDesert because of its role in increasing the amount of biomass that can carry fire through the desert.Â  Additionally, roadside verges may serve as corridors for the movement of native plant species to new areas; the ability of native plants to migrate may become increasingly important under global climate change (Pitelka and the Plant Migration Workshop Group 1997). 

</p>
<p>

  


</p>
<p>

  Urban areas, including freeway corridors, are intensively managed. This study will consider human management and urban development as integral and natural parts of the ecosystem under study. This experiment is part of a larger study (my dissertation) that will advance ecological understanding of the plant species that are able to move through existing corridors in arid and semi-arid urban areas. Understanding the similarities and differences in traits that affect movement of plant species along corridors will provide evidence as to whether native and non-native or functional groupings of species actually move differently in corridors. It will contribute to the literature on assessing the potential for particular plant species to invade new areas. Linking local plant processes to the larger landscape scale of movement between cities and undeveloped areas will have important implications for conservation planning in both types of environments.

</p>
<p>

  


</p>
<p>

  To investigate the effect of nitrogen fertilization and water availability on roadside plant communities, I propose to collect soil containing  roadside seed banks from several of the 20 sites I previously selected for my dissertation research.Â  The 20 sites are divided into 4 different land cover categories: desert, low density residential, high density residential, and cropland.Â  The latter 2 categories are sites where the roadside verges have been landscaped and covered with gravel.Â  I will collect an equal volume of soil from 8 sites, 2 in each category.Â  The soil from all 8 sites will be composited and mixed with sand to produce a homogeneous soil and seed mixture with extractable nitrate equal to 7 mg per kg soil, matching the average extractable nitrate level found in the CAP LTER 200 point survey (Hope 
, in prep).Â  This soil mixture will be used in a 2-way block design with 4 levels of nitrogen and 3 levels of water, as shown in the table below.Â  The samples will be germinated in horticultural plant cells in the LSA greenhouse for 3 months.

</p>
<p>

  I expect that the total number of plants germinating will increase in treatments with higher nitrogen and higher water levels.I also expect that species with varying functional traits will germinate differentially across the treatments as well.Â  Ruderal plants are likely to respond favorably to higher levels of nitrogen, while low-nutrient adapted species are likely to germinate more readily at levels of nitrogen more similar to native desert conditions.Â  The result of crossing N levels with differing water levels will yield information on species that are likely to do extremely well in years of high rainfall, which may suggest additional plants that could spread into the desert in a manner similar to 
.

</p>
<p>

  The data will be analyzed using 2-way ANOVAs on both total number of plants germinating and number of species germinating.Â  I will also analyze various species traits, such as water requirements, typical nutrient regime, plant strategy (Grime 2001), and native vs. non-native, to determine whether species falling into these different groups tend to germinate under various combinations of water and nitrogen levels.Â

<b>Timeframe and Availability to Assist with General CAP Research</b>


</p>
<p>

  I will collect the soil for this project in late May and plan to begin the experiment in early June after homogenizing the soil samples and adjusting the nitrate concentration.Â  Once the experiment has been started in early June, my schedule will be quite flexible and I will be available to work with senior CAP scientists as needed for the rest of the summer. Â I expect that there will be ongoing work with data entry and plant mapping and tagging at the NorthDesertVillage; however, if that work is completed, I have experience that could be useful to assist Nancy Grimm, Sharon Hall, Chris Martin or possibly Joe Fernando on other CAP LTER research projects. Â I intend to spend the balance of my time identifying and mounting voucher specimens from my vegetation surveys and completing soil texture analyses on archived samples previously collected at my 20 dissertation field sites.Â  

</p>
<p>

  
<b>Prior CAP Support and Data Availability</b>


</p>

  I have received CAP support as a Research Assistant in 2 semesters.Â  During Fall 2001, I researched and summarized the data available on invasive plants within the CAP research area.Â  I am currently serving as an RA during Spring 2006, working on invasive plant and plant migration research and assisting with data collection and database development for the NorthDesertVillage project under the Biodiversity IPA.Â  I have also received funding from CAP for soil chemistry analyses as part of my dissertation.Â  I have presented posters at CAP research symposia for the last 3 years, as well as giving talks on CAP research in general and my dissertation in specific at the Royal Botanic Gardens and Mark McDonnell s Landscape Ecology lab in Melbourne, Australia and the Ecological Society of Australia Annual Meeting in Adelaide in 2004.Â  I have presented my data at numerous other venues as well (see my CV for details).Â  I am developing an Access database with my dissertation data, which I will provide to CAP LTER at the conclusion of my degree; the data generated under this summer grant will be included.

"182","Performance of Xeriscaped Stormwater Retention Basins in Nitrogen Retention and Removal","<p>

  In the Central Arizona - Phoenix Long Term Ecological Research (CAP LTER) project area, developments with lot sizes &lt; 1 acre are required to handle on-site storm runoff.  Stormwater retention basins are a common option for flood abatement.  Research has shown that urban stormwater tends to have high nutrient concentrations.  For example, Hope et al. (2004) found average nitrate 
 concentration of runoff from parking lots in the CAP LTER to be 15.4 mg N/L, compared to 0.4 mg N/L in undeveloped desert sites.  Ammonium (NH
<sub>4</sub>
<sup>+</sup>
) concentration was also elevated. The CAP LTER has high N input from deposition and fertilization, as well as NO
<sub>3</sub>
-contaminated groundwater (Baker et al. 2001).  If retention basins can store or remove nitrogen (N) from stormwater as well as mitigating floods, they would provide an additional ecosystem service to the city.

</p>
<p>

   Researchers have found that retention-basin soils in more mesic climates effectively remove pollutants within the top few centimeters (Datry et al. 2003, Dechesne et al. 2005), but the filtration capacity of basins in arid areas has not been fully investigated (but see Zhu et al. 2004).  I have conducted some preliminary research on xeriscaped basins in Tempe and Phoenix to assess general chemical and physical characteristics.  Results have shown that these basins have average soil NH
<sub>4</sub>
<sup>+</sup>
 and NO
<sub>3</sub>
<sup>-</sup>
 concentrations of 1.7 and 4.8 Î¼g N/g dry soil, respectively (
.  When compared to the CAP LTER s 200-point soil survey, these values are approximately 4 and 8 times (respectively) lower than the mean for urban land use (Hope et al. 2005). Given that these basins are likely to be receiving very high N loads, these data suggest that N is being removed or exports from these systems.  What are the mechanisms that explain the lowered N concentrations in these soils? Three alternative hypotheses will be investigated: low N results from a) export to recipient systems (groundwater), b) retention in microbial biomass or soil organic matter, or c) removal via denitrification.  I will investigate processes rates and responses to flooding to construct mass balances for retention basins that will allow discrimination among the hypotheses.  


</p>
<p>

  I have access to eight stormwater retention basins on the grounds of schools in the Paradise Valley Unified School District (PVUSD) of North Phoenix.  These basins drain either parking lots, rooftops, or a combination of both.  For the intensive study, I will select three basins for instrumentation and monitoring during the summer 2006 monsoon season, one of each type of inflow. I plan to catch two complete storms.  Chemical, hydrological, and biological parameters must be determined to adequately assess basin performance and budgets. Each basin has 1 ?? 2 main inflows (downspouts, channels from parking lots).  One inflow per basin will be instrumented with either a Global Water Composite sampler and stormwater volume will be calculated to estimate total load of N to each basin for a given storm.  If more than 1 inflow exists, grab samples will also be taken to determine if these inflows differ chemically from the first inflow.  To quantify soil solution losses of N, lysimeters will be installed and water infiltration and evaporation evaluated.  Some basins also have dry wells, which will be instrumented with ISCO autosamplers and flow meters as well to estimate this export.  To assess possible removal of N via denitrification, core samples will be taken for analysis with membrane-inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) (Hartnett and Seitzinger 2003), and then scaled-up for areal estimates.  Table 1 summarizes these methods.

  All water samples will be analyzed for NO

, DOC, and TN, bulk physical characteristics, denitrification potential, net mineralization, and microbial biomass C and N.  Cores will also be taken for MIMS analysis.

</p>
<p>

  CAP LTER and the School of Life Sciences have ISCO autosamplers, but to instruments for the inflows must be purchased. The Global Water Composite Sampler is relatively compact, securable, inexpensive, and can take ??first flush? as well as composite samples. Because expensive equipment will be left unattended in public locations, there must be additional expenditure on storage units to secure the equipment.  Bins of sufficient size to accommodate the ISCO samplers and batteries will be purchased, along with padlocks.

</p>
<p>

  Results from this study will enhance existing knowledge about N dynamics in the CAP LTER region, and are a fundamental first step in assessing the value of ecosystem services provided by retention basins, a common feature in the area.  Results of this study will be prepared for publication in journals such as Urban Ecosystems, Biogeochemistry, Journal of Environmental Quality, or Water Resources Research.
</p>
<p>

  Because this work will be conducted in PVUSD retention basins, an additional broader impact is the potential connection with students at the schools.  Although the students will not be in session during the summer monsoon season, this work is an integral part of my dissertation and I plan on continuing my fieldwork in the PVUSD.  After gaining a basic understanding of basin response to storms, I would like to work with Ecology Explorers  to design a program for students to participate in stormwater monitoring during the winter rainy season.

"183","The Effects of Urbanization on Heterogeneity and Process in the Sonoran Desert","
<p>

  The proposed research addresses the question, andldquoHow does urbanization affect the availability and distribution of nutrient pools and dynamics?andrdquo  I hypothesize that availability and distribution of soil nutrients is affected through two main components of urbanization: indirect human influence through exposure to the altered urban climate; and direct human influence through land management practices.  During the summer of 2006, I collected soil samples in three landscape types with varying degrees of human influence: outlying desert, urban desert, and xeriscaped residential yards.  While xeriscaped yards and urban desert support similar pools of organic matter and inorganic N, xeriscapes have elevated soil moisture and lower net potential N cycling than urban desert. Addition of leaf tissue chemistry data would help elucidate the N cycle in xeriscapes and connect above- and belowground nutrient dynamics.  For all soil pools and processes measured, urban sites were more variable than outlying desert.  While the study conducted in 2006 provided a good andlsquosnapshot of nutrient pools and dynamics in xeriscapes, a larger sample size would greatly improve the value and statistical power of these findings.  In the summer of 2007, I propose to double the sample size for each landscape type and measure soil organic matter, total carbon and nitrogen, and leaf tissue chemistry.

Introduction


</p>
<p>

  Arid ecosystems cover approximately one third of the earth s surface, and are being altered by urban development at an unprecedented rate (FAO 1989).'Urbanization influences the main drivers of biogeochemical cycles by manipulating hydrology, atmospheric chemistry, nutrient cycles, land use, and land cover (Kaye et al 2006).Â  In the Sonoran desert, biogeochemical cycles are constrained by both water and nutrient availability.Â  Urban development in the Phoenix metropolitan area has redistributed these limiting factors, evening availability through both space and time.Â  This raises particular interest in elucidating biogeochemical cycles within the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research (CAP LTER) site.Â 

</p>
<p>

  Several studies in the CAP LTER site have demonstrated effects of urbanization on belowground ecosystem processes within the Phoenix metropolitan area.Â  Results from the 200-point survey demonstrate that exposure to Phoenix s urban climate elevates inorganic soil N and net potential N processing rates (Zhu et al 2006, Hope et al 2005).Â  Furthermore, Lewis et al (2006) showed that prior agricultural use increases pools of soil organic matter, total carbon, and total nitrogen for at least 20 years after agricultural activity ends.Â  Not only does urbanization affect the sizes of soil nutrient pools, it also alters their spatial distribution.Â  The characteristic resource island pattern in undisturbed desert is absent in agricultural fields and mesic parks (Jenerette et al 2006).Â  Because of their stark difference from the surrounding desert, agriculture and mesic landscapes have received particular attention from CAP LTER researchers.Â  However, xeric, or low water-use landscaping is a popular, yet seldom-studied land cover type within the CAP ecosystem.Â 

</p>
<p>

  In the Phoenix metropolitan area, xeric or mixed landscapes containing xeric vegetation represent 54% of residential yards and 20% of the urban land area (Corinna Gries, personal communication).Â  These xeriscaped yards often include native plant species that have replaced non-native species.Â  Traditionally, ecological restoration projects focused on replacing non-native plants with native species, and assumed restored ecosystem function would follow. However, increasing evidence indicates that function does not always follow form, particularly in highly altered environments like urban areas.Â 

</p>
<p>

  To compare the belowground function of xeriscaped yards with undisturbed desert, I employed a spatially explicit sampling design beneath and away from two native Sonoran desert plants that are also common in xeric landscaping: brittlebush ( 
Encelia farinosa
 ) and Palo verde trees ( 
Parkinsonia spp.
 ).Â  I hypothesized that availability and distribution of soil nutrients would be affected through two main components of urbanization: indirect human influence through exposure to the altered urban climate; and direct human influence through land management. To distinguish urban climate effects from direct human management, I sampled sites in undisturbed desert preserves within the urban airshed, or andlsquourban desert sites, and compared these to undisturbed desert away from the urban climate, or andlsquooutlying desert, and xeriscaped yards that were preceded by grass lawn and agriculture. Â I predicted that indirect human influence in urban desert would enrich soil resources compared to outlying desert, and direct human management would further increase soil resource availability (Figure 1).Â  In addition, the magnitude of resource islands beneath plants would be decreased in urban desert by elevation of soil resources between plants.Â  Previous agricultural and lawn maintenance in xeriscaped yards would result in the most even distribution of soil resources of the three landscape types (Figure 2).

</p>

Results from Previous CAP LTER Funding


</p>
<p>

  I was fortunate to receive a summer research grant from the CAP LTER project in 2006. Â Results showed that soil resources varied according to landscape type, plant species, and proximity to plant canopy.Â  Inorganic soil N and SOM pools beneath Palo verde trees were statistically similar among sites, regardless of position within the urban landscape. Â In contrast, resource pools beneath brittlebushes were elevated inside the city.Â  Exposure to the urban climate nearly tripled inorganic soil N near brittlebushes from 9.5 Âµg N/gram dry soil in outlying desert to 35.1 Âµg N/gram dry soil in urban desert. Â This trend is consistent with Survey 200 results (Jenerette et al 2006, Zhu et al 2006).Â  SOM and net potential N cycling were also elevated in urban compared to outlying desert sites.

</p>
<p>

  Human management in xeriscaped yards did not alter pools of SOM or inorganic N beyond the effects of the urban atmosphere.Â  Yet despite this, mean rates of net potential N cycling in xeriscaped yards were half of that in urban deserts.Â  Furthermore, xeriscaped yards contained significantly higher soil moisture (mean of 1.88%) than either urban desert or outlying desert (means of 1.08% and 0.98%, respectively) (Figure 3).Â  While 2 of 5 xeriscaped yards received drip irrigation, the soil moisture content in these yards was not significantly different from yards that did not receive any supplemental irrigation.Â  In addition, soil moisture was elevated between plants as well as beneath plants where drip irrigation occurs, indicating that either soil properties or local microclimate conditions contribute to this difference.Â  The decreased net potential N cycling rates may reflect an increase in N uptake by microbes and plants that is enabled by improved water availability.Â  However, further work is needed to explain this finding.Â 

</p>
<p>

  These results reflect work performed at 5 sites in each land use category.Â  While some conclusions can be drawn, the highly variable nature of the urban system resulted in non-significant results for some variables.Â  For example, patterns of soil organic matter cannot be resolved with the current sample size and data set (Figure 4).Â  It is unclear whether these landscape types are truly similar, or if the high variability between urban sites masks differences between sites.Â 

</p>
<p>

  

</p>
<p>

  I presented these results at two meetings: the LTER All-Scientist Meeting in Estes Park, Colorado, in September, 2006; and the 9 
<sup>th</sup>
 annual CAP LTER Poster Symposium in January, 2007.

</p>
<p>

  
Â 


</p>
<p>

  
Proposed Work for Summer 2007


</p>
<p>

  During the summer of 2007, I propose to increase sample size to 10 Â sites in each landscape type in order to increase statistical power for soil organic matter, total carbon and total nitrogen. These soil resource pools change slowly so that comparison between 2006 and 2007 would be possible.Â  In addition, I will collect leaves from brittlebush and Palo verde trees to compare tissue chemistry.Â  This aboveground nutrient pool would provide an interesting link between above- and belowground ecosystem processes.Â  Leaf tissue chemistry may also help determine whether plants in xeriscaped yards use more N than deserts plants.Â  Research conducted by an undergraduate researcher in Nancy Grimm s lab indicated a trend toward low C:N ratios within the city, but lack statistical power to draw a conclusion (Bony Ahmed, unpublished data). Higher plant N demand could explain reduced net potential N cycling in xeriscaped yards compared to urban deserts.

</p>

  This work will be conducted under the supervision and guidance of Dr. Sharon Hall.Â  All data and results collected for this research project will be shared with the CAP-LTER Information Manager.

"185","Solute Transport Modeling of Rivers in Response to Storm Events","
<p>

  The everlasting need to supply immense quantities of potable water to the millions of humans inhabiting the Phoenix Metropolitan area has resulted in a vast number of managed water systems, both canals and rivers, networked throughout the state of Arizona.  There is significant effort built into maintaining the quality of water in the area for drinking, irrigation and the co-existence of plants and animals in the desert environment.  Understanding the biogeochemical processes affecting the nature of solutes in both transporting and recipient systems throughout the managed river systems is vital to assuring the availability of high quality water.  Concerns about water quality are reflected in plans to study fluxes of nutrients and toxins in the CAP2 renewal proposal.  The proposal includes a plan to determine spatial and temporal distributions of contaminants in surface water and soils in an effort to understand the dynamics of solute transport.  The research proposed here is complementary to the efforts underway in the CAP-LTER project.  Two local watersheds that act as sources of water for the Phoenix basin are monitored with interests focused on characterizing transport mechanisms during regional storm events.

</p>

","
<p>

  The CAP-LTER approach to studying nutrient and toxin fluxes in surface waters is to collect spatially distributed samples at the same time (Verde River, Salt River, CAP Canal, 91
<sup>st</sup>
 Ave. Treatment Plant, Gila River).'An alternate approach is to study water chemistry at one location as water moves through the system over a set time interval.Â  This approach is facilitated by the large storm events beginning in December of 2004 that provide flowing water through the CAP-LTER study area.Â  Daily sampling of the Salt River at Tempe Town Lake began on January 5 and ended October 1, 2005.Â  I propose to use these samples together with additional Verde and Salt River samples collected weekly and monthly to answer three fundamental questions:

</p>
<p>

  1. How do rain events affect solute transport within rivers in arid regions, including those that are often dry?

</p>
<p>

  2. How are management practices (human â?? ecosystem interaction like dam release) reflected in the changing chemical composition of these rivers?

</p>
<p>

  3. Are there unique anthropogenic signals (trace element fingerprints), indicative of an urbanizing ecosystem, present in the water as it moves into and through the study area?

</p>
<p>

  The Phoenix Basin is comprised of several arid climate rivers that rarely receive high flow due to storm runoff.Â  A large quantity of rain fell throughout much of Central Arizona in a series of anomalous storm events that began in December 2004 and ended in February 2005 giving us the rare opportunity to measure and study solute fluxes and transport in a natural system.Â  Phoenix and all of its watersheds were heavily impacted by these storms.Â  Inflatable dams constructed to form what is now Tempe Town Lake from the Salt River were removed following the large storms, and water was allowed to flow freely for the first time in many years producing nearly natural flow in the Salt River.Â  The normally managed watershed metamorphosed into a natural river system with potential chemical inputs from surrounding natural surfaces such as soils and human built surfaces such as freeways.

</p>
<p>

  My sampling was focused on the Upper and Lower Salt and Lower Verde watersheds as shown on the regional map in Figure 1.Â  The Upper Salt watershed (yellow) is located east of Phoenix and the Lower Salt watershed contains much of Phoenix (Fig. 1).Â  The Lower Verde watershed (green) is located north of Phoenix (Fig. 1).Â  A sample site located downstream from the confluence of these two prominent watersheds along the Salt River at Tempe Town Lake between Mill Avenue and Rural Road was selected for daily sample collection (Fig. 1).Â  Additional sample locations were added to complement temporal data with spatial information.Â  These include samples taken weekly along the Verde and Salt Rivers upstream of both Granite Reef Dam and the confluence, downstream of Tempe Town Lake along the Salt River at 40
<sup>th</sup>
 street, and the lower and upper Salt River with its many reservoirs and tributaries on a monthly basis (Fig. 1).Â  The hydrograph measured from the Salt River at the Priest Drive gauging station downstream of Tempe Town Lake quantifies the events (Fig. 2).Â  Daily measurements and samples were collected throughout these events.

</p>
<p>

  A suite of information is gathered in the field at all sample locations that includes: pH, conductivity, temperature, alkalinity, and turbidity.Â  Water samples were collected for measuring major solutes (by ion chromatography, IC), trace elements (by High Resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry, HR-ICP-MS) and stable isotope (by Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry, IR-MS in the Keck Lab).Â  Bottles for IC analysis were rinsed in triplicate with NanoPure deionized (DI) water then soaked for a minimum of 24 hours before being used.Â  In the field, IC sample bottles are rinsed once with filtered sample then filled with 30mL of filtered sample.Â  A 0.2/0.8 micron membrane syringe filter is used to remove fine particulate, with a 2-micron glass fiber pre-filter.Â  Samples are analyzed by ion chromatography with help from Natasha Zolotova in Everett Shock s lab.Â  Bottles for ICP analysis are soaked in 10% nitric acid for a minimum of 24 hours, then rinsed with NanoPure DI water in triplicate and dried.Â  The bottles are spiked with 200 micro-liters of trace metal free, ultra-pure nitric acid to ensure sample preservation with no precipitation of solids.Â  The same filtering technique is used to collect 30mL of sample.Â  No pre-rinse is required as the bottles are cleaned in the lab and the final concentration of acid is predetermined.Â  Dr. Panjai Prapaipong is assisting me while running samples on the High Resolution ICP-MS in Dr. Everett Shock s lab.

</p>
<p>

  When sample analysis is complete, I will have 70 measurements on each of approximately 500 samples collected before, after and throughout the storm events.Â  Samples run on the IC measure major cations including Na, K, Ca, Mg and major anions including Cl, NO
<sub>3</sub>
, NO
<sub>2</sub>
, Br, SO
<sub>4</sub>
, PO
<sub>4</sub>
.Â  The ICP measures a suite of 52 trace and minor elements that include, but is not limited to As, Cu, U, Cr, Mn, Mo, V, Co, Fe, Ni, Al, Rb, Y, B, Li, Sr, Cs and Rare Earth Elements.

</p>
<p>

  Analysis of preliminary data reveals that variations in major element chemistry correlate with high discharge events along the river system, whether natural or human induced.Â  We have found that discharge and solute flux are out of phase with each other following storm events resulting in hysteresis behavior.Â  Evans et al. (1998) considered temperate climate streams in the Adirondacks, New York, and found that hysteresis behavior following storm events can be attributed to compositional differences in a three component mixing model.Â  Total stream flow at any time is the sum of baseflow, surface runoff, and soil flow creating a typical storm response hydrograph that peaks sharply then slowly declines (Fig. 3).Â  Each of these components has a difference composition (considered to be constant over time) and also reaches a peak flow at a different time.Â  When discharge is plotted against concentration, the lag that occurs between the timing of component discharge peaks following a storm event creates loops.Â  The exact form of the loop behavior has been described by Evans et. al. (1998) for 6 variations of component mixing during the course of peak stream flow.Â  A question we are considering is whether this model can be applied to an arid climate watershed or whether it must be modified and tested with the dataset collected.Â  The Salt and Verde River system is further complicated by the mixing zone after the confluence adding complexities to hysteresis behavior.Â  The chloride hysteresis diagram is shown in Figure 4.Â  The crenulations observed in the loop behavior can be explained by distinct compositional differences between the Salt and Verde River and changing discharge ratios at the mixing zone.

</p>
<p>

  Measured differences of some solutes in the Salt and Verde River water span two orders of magnitude, which will have a major impact on hysteresis loops.Â  Results from samples collected between 12 January to 29 March 2005 at the Salt River and Verde River upstream from the mixing zone are shown on the Piper diagram plotted as percent milli-equivalents per liter (Fig. 5).Â  The average Salt River composition plots in the sodium-calcium cation facies and chloride-sulfate-bicarbonate anion facies.Â  This is distinctly different from the average Verde River sample which plots in the calcium-sodium cation facies and bicarbonate-chloride-sulfate anion facies.Â  These differences in major element composition between the main tributaries may be accompanied by unique nutrient and trace element variations.

</p>
<p>

  Not all solutes exhibit this same hydrochemical response to storm perturbations.Â  Nutrients such as nitrate (NO
<sub>3</sub>
<sup>-</sup>
) are inverted with respect to the chloride hysteresis (Fig. 6).Â  As discharge increases during a storm event, the concentration of nitrate eventually decreases forming a clockwise loop.Â  The hysteresis behavior of toxins behave different from major ions and nutrients.Â  For example, uranium hysteresis plots as a bowtie loop (Fig. 7).Â  The complex nature of these loops leads us to believe that watershed-wide water/rock reaction, as well as human-ecosystem interactions, control solute transport.

</p>
<p>

  These differing behaviors suggest that we need to consider a more complicated model of mixing, upstream hysteresis and possibly human impact.Â  We believe that at some level, groundwater, soil flushing, surface storm runoff, chemical interactions and mixing are all adding to the hysteresis complexities.Â  Nevertheless, it is possible to resolve the river inputs, mixing and transport mechanics of this system with the robust dataset being assembled.Â  Using the data collected and understanding the complexities causing the hysteresis behavior during solute transport will enable transport models to be constructed for storm flow in a large-scale arid watershed mixing zone.

  The urban raptor survey is a project intended to identify as many urban raptor sites in and around the metro area as possible. We are collecting location data and nest attributes during the spring 2006 nesting season so that we can gain an insight into how raptors are adapting to the increasing spread of urban development. The project is utilizing volunteer resources to identify nest sites which are then validated by CAP LTER birding technicians. The information collected will eventually be placed in a GIS database so that we can perform spatial analysis on urban raptor nesting habits.

"192","Lotic Intersite Nitrogen Experiment (LINX)","<p>Human activities are flooding the biosphere with fixed nitrogen (N), changing the biogeochemistry of both terrestrial and aquatic environments by adding biologically available N, primarily from fossil fuel combustion, agricultural fertilizer application and legume cultivation. The fate of much of the anthropogenic N load to the biosphere is uncertain because mass balance studies of major watersheds show that most of the added N is not exported to the oceans but is missing, having disappeared from our accounting somewhere within these watersheds. Despite this, the added N that we can account for produces a N loading to estuaries and coastal oceans that has resulted in increasingly severe eutrophication problems. </p>
<p>Among the several possible fates of the missing N are uptake and denitrification in streams and rivers. Most of the inorganic N entering and transported by streams and rivers is in the form of nitrate. Traditionally, nitrate has been thought to flow freely downstream to lakes and coastal ecosystems once it enters streams. Recently, however, this view has been challenged. Mass balance analyses for the Mississippi River drainage have shown that large quantities of total N and nitrate are lost as water travels through its tributary streams and rivers. This conclusion is consistent with results from our recently completed inter-site 15N-tracer study of ammonium dynamics in streams (LINX). The LINX study demonstrated experimentally that smaller streams are most retentive of ammonium, with shortest ammonium uptake distances (i.e., greatest retention efficiencies) in the smallest streams and uptake distances increasing logarithmically with stream discharge and depth. </p>
<p>We propose an intensive, inter-site study of the fate of nitrate in streams. Our research will evaluate whether streams are indeed important sites of N retention in the landscape and, more importantly, how human disturbances affect that retention. We will use field 15N-tracer experiments to determine the rates and factors controlling nitrate uptake and retention in relatively pristine streams and in streams that have been altered by agriculture or urban development and have elevated nitrate levels. These experiments and associated measurements will allow us to test a variety of hypotheses dealing with the impacts of human disturbances on streams, including effects on channel morphology, hydraulics, biological activity, and N retention. At each of eight sites distributed across diverse biomes throughout the U.S., we will perform tracer-level 15N-nitrate addition experiments to trace the fate of nitrate in nine streams: 3 reference, 3 agricultural and 3 urban streams (for a total of 72 streams across all sites). Each experiment will consist of a 24-h addition of 15N-nitrate and longitudinally distributed measurements of 15N in water and in various benthic organic matter pools to determine in-situ rates of nitrification, assimilatory uptake of nitrate, and denitrification in each stream. We will use our experimental results to develop a general, process-based model of nitrate retention in stream reaches. We then will extend our results to much larger spatial scales by combining our stream model with GIS-based information on hydrography and land use to predict nitrate retention in 5th or 6th order river basins at each of the eight study sites. We will test these predictions with synoptic field measurements of stream nitrate concentrations within each basin. The validated river basin model will be an important land-use planning and management tool for controlling the N loading of lakes and coastal ecosystems. </p>
<p>Our proposed research integrates across a large range of spatial scales, from the micro-scale (microelectrode surveys for anoxia, microbial denitrification enzyme assays) to stream reaches (assimilatory uptake and denitrification rates) to landscapes of diverse biomes (nitrate retention throughout the fluvial systems of 5thor 6th order river basins, impacts of land use). Our research also will integrate experimental results using a relatively new technique (15N tracer additions) with modeling at the stream reach and landscape scales. Our work will have broader implications to society by explicitly evaluating the effects of human disturbance on N retention in stream networks, contributing the new knowledge needed for a more sustainable management of watersheds. The many graduate students and postdoctoral fellows funded by the project will gain valuable training and perspective on how large, interdisciplinary team research projects involving multiple sites and institutions are conducted and managed.  </p>

"193","The Impact of the Urban Heat Island on Frosts and Freezes in Phoenix, Arizona, USA","
<p>

  

</p>
<p>

  Rapid, extensive urbanization has caused a rise in minimum temperatures within metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona during the past half century.  Though much urban heat island (UHI) research within the region focuses on summer temperatures, this project examines the temporal and spatial change in frost and freeze patterns within the metropolitan area during the past decade.   The study uses temperature records from 1995 through 2005 from 14 weather stations scattered across the metropolitan area, and situated in urban, suburban and rural settings.  Station data are evaluated for changes in the number and duration of frost/freeze events ?? the number of hours and days at or below the 4°C threshold, the point at which plants become stressed by cold.  Statistical analysis is used to determine similarities, differences, and change in stations  temperature patterns that may be linked to encroaching urbanization.

"194","Salt River Paleo-Geomorphology","As Basin and Range extensional tectonism waned in the late Pliocene, continental drainage shifted as the southern Colorado Plateau uplifted and the Gulf of California opened. Regional drainage integration connected the Plateau to the Gulf via the lower Colorado River and its tributaries.  The Salt River drains central Arizona westward and joins the Gila River 20 km southwest of Phoenix. Abundant geologic and geomorphic evidence can be combined to constrain the timing and processes that have influenced channel migration vertically and horizontally.

The Salt River has a well preserved fluvial terrace sequence from Phoenix eastward for 50 km and a buried paleochannel south of the modern channel system that establishes the history of channel migration.  Subsurface information shows extensive Salt River channel gravels joining the Gila River roughly 25 kilometers(km) from where it joins the Gila today, implying a significant diversion of the main channel to its modern location occurred around South Mountain (16m higher local elevation difference). The diversion initiated flow of the modern Salt River through the Papago Narrows (10 km east of Phoenix). The channel moved 8 km laterally from its southern path, an unlikely localization given the local bedrock highs there).  The mid Pleistocene terrace can be traced from the eastern mountains to the Papago Narrows, constraining a minimum age for the modern channel. The buried paleochannel may represent the downstream equivalent of the missing earlier Pleistocene terrace, indicating significant changes in Salt River channel gradient and horizontal position since the early to middle Pleistocene.",NULL,NULL
"196","LTER TRENDS Population and Economy, 1790-1960","
<p>

  The purpose of this project is to collect population and economic variables for all 26 LTER sites at the county (or county equivalent) level from 1790-1960. Population variables include Total Population, Urban Population, Slave Population, and Population Density. Economic variables include: AGRICULTURE, # Farmers, Acres Farmland [improved], Acres Farmland [unimproved], Value farm output, Acres unimproved woodland, Value of forest products; COMMERCE (wholesale/retail), # employed in commerce, # commercial establishments, wages paid; MANUFACTURING, # employed in manufacturing, Value manufacturing output, # manufacturing establishments, wages paid, SERVICES, #employed in services, value of services, # of service establishments, and wages paid. Ted Gragson (p.i. CWT) at the University of Georgia will be collecting these data for 1970 to 2000. Variables were chosen on the knowledge that they are significant (though certainly by no means the only) drivers of ecological change and because they reflect broad changes in society over the long term. These particular variables can be compiled in a relatively consistent manner over the course of the US census. When the database is complete, all data will be attributed to a GIS using historical county boundary files from HUSCO (

) and the Newberry Library (

"197","Experimental Assessment of Nitrate Filtration Capacity of Xeriscaped Stormwater Retention Basin Soils","  
    Stormwater retention basins are designed to provide the ecosystem services of flood abatement and groundwater recharge.  However, studies have shown that stormwater tends to have high nutrient concentrations, which may incur future costs if groundwater is used for drinking water.  If retention basins can store or remove nitrate from stormwater as well as mitigating floods, they would provide an additional, valuable ecosystem service to the CAP LTER, which has documented high levels on nitrogen input.  Researchers in more mesic climates have found that soils in retention basins effectively remove pollutants within the top few centimeters, but the filtration capacity of basins in arid areas has not been investigated.  As a preliminary laboratory evaluation of retention basin soils, we collected replicate cores of approximately 10 cm depth from a non-grassy basin.  We then had two treatments groups of pure water and water amended with potassium nitrate (KNO3). Bulk analyses on all cores were performed and leachates and soil extracts were collected for ion and organic carbon content analysis.  Initial treatments indicated an overall flushing of ions in all treatments, indicating that the soils add nitrate to recipient systems. Results from these manipulations will be coupled with future field investigations to assess the filtration capacity of xeriscaped stormwater retention basins, a common feature in the CAP LTER.

"198","Urban landscape patterns: Complex dynamics and emergent properties","
<p>

  Urban development in the United States is profoundly changing landscape pattern and biodiversity and in turn it is being affected by these changes. Yet we are just beginning to understand the interactions between patterns and processes in human dominated landscapes. One of the least understood aspects of urban landscape dynamics is the way in which local interactions of human and biophysical processes affect the landscape patterns of metropolitan regions. Urban landscapes exhibit some fundamental features of complex self-organizing systems. They are highly heterogeneous, spatially nested, and hierarchically structured. The urban spatial structure can be described as a cumulative and aggregate pattern that results from numerous local decisions involving a large number of adaptive agents interacting among themselves and with biophysical factors. These behaviors eventually can lead to different metropolitan patterns.

</p>
<p>

   

</p>
<p>

  Furthermore, in these disequilibrium systems, uncertainty is important since any change that departs from past trends can affect the path of future landscape evolution. In this project we propose to study urban landscapes as emergent phenomena which result from local interactions of human agents, real estate markets, built infrastructure, and biophysical factors such as land cover, geomorphology, and natural disturbance regimes. Here we define emergent phenomena as structures, patterns and properties in a complex system that are not possessed by any of its parts. We ask four questions:

</p>
<p>

   

</p>

<ol>
<li>


    How do dynamic landscape systems evolve to generate emergent patterns that we see in urban landscapes?
  

</li>
<li>


    What nonlinearities, thresholds, discontinuities, and path dependencies explain divergent trajectories of urban landscapes?
  

</li>
<li>


    How do emergent urban landscape patterns influence biodiversity and ecosystem functioning? and
  

</li>
<li>


    How can planning integrate this knowledge to develop sustainable urban landscape patterns?
  

</li>
</ol>

<p>

   

</p>
<p>

  Our overarching hypotheses are that:

</p>

<ol>
<li>


    urban landscapes are dynamic patch mosaics that are hierarchically structured resulting from local interactions between human and biophysical agents;
  

</li>
<li>


    spatial interactions between socio-economic and biophysical patterns and processes in the urban landscape lead to emergent properties (e.g., sprawl); and
  

</li>
<li>


    emergent landscape patterns affect biodiversity in nonlinear ways (e.g., the intermediate disturbance hypothesis). We intend to formally test hypotheses about the emergent properties of urban landscapes using an agent-based, patch dynamic, hierarchical modeling approach.
  

</li>
</ol>

<p>

   

</p>

<p>

  We implement this approach using a dynamic probabilistic relational model (DPRM) in which parameters and spatial rules are estimated empirically from two longitudinal land cover and land use data sets developed for the Seattle and Phoenix Metropolitan Areas. While Markov models have been widely used in data mining, they are limited because their definition of state does not allow us to represent multiple state classes that exist in most real-world domains. Mobile robotics and landscape modeling are two different but similar examples of multiple states where first-order Markov models face significant limitations. Here we propose to apply a dynamic probabilistic relational modeling approach to represent a heterogeneous and hierarchically structured domain such as the urban landscape.

</p>
<p>

  
<b>Intellectual Merit</b>
 . This project aims to advance our understanding of the emergence of urban landscape patterns driven simultaneously by human and biophysical dynamics. We propose a new approach to the study of coupled human-natural dynamics and empirically test this approach in two different bioregions (Seattle and Phoenix). This project also employs new computational techniques that are of importance to a broad range of disciplines studying human dynamics, ecology and artificial intelligence. We have formed a unique project team, which includes a diverse group of faculty from several disciplines including urban planning, sociology, public policy, landscape ecology, wildlife biology, computer science, robotics, and statistics.

<b>Broader Impacts</b>
 . This project aims to develop a better understanding of complex human-ecological dynamics leading to development patterns such as sprawl, one of the most pressing and controversial problem in the United States. We expect the results of this research to have an impact on both the social and natural sciences particularly the study of development patterns, land use change, and public policy in urbanizing regions. We also expect that the close collaboration among the social and natural scientists and experts in statistics and robotics will foster new quantitative methods and modeling approaches that better suites an understanding of human and ecological dynamics.

"199","Ecosystem services","
<p>

  We are proposing a (synthesis of already-available data and information, or relatively easy-to-find data and information) on ecosystem services in the Phoenix Basin.

</p>
<p>

   The analysis will incorporate three perspectives:

</p>

<ol>
<li>


    An ecological or natural science perspective (what is the ecological provisioning of various ecosystem services; is this provisioning being degraded or enhanced over time)
  

</li>
<li>


    An economic or human value perspective (do humans value the service in question), and
  

</li>
<li>


    A technological or engineering perspective (which services have technologically feasible and affordable substitutes).
  

</li>
</ol>

<p>

  Such an analysis would allow us to identify in the PhoenixBasin. Such services would be those that are being degraded ecologically, are highly valued by citizens, and for which there are no reasonable technological substitutes. Identification of these critical services could guide future research, and identify important areas for discussions between policymakers in the Valley and scientists at ASU.

</p>
We will conduct this analysis by assembling three teams, organized along the topics listed above. The natural science team will be led by Ann Kinzig, the value team is being co-led by Charles Perrings and Sharon Harlan, and the technological team is being led by John Crittenden.

"203","Baseline Data for a Burned Area in South Mountain Park in Phoenix, Arizona","There have been many fires in the South Mountain Park throughout its history.  Unfortunately, there has been no known detailed documentation (baseline data) of the exact perimeter and area of these burns or of post-fire vegetation changes.  This information can be invaluable for future researchers years, decades, and possibly even centuries from now for monitoring how the landscape changes over time in comparison to unburned areas, measuring individual species recovery rates, and making informed fire management and restoration decisions.  We collected baseline data of the June 12, 2005  fire in South Mountain Park in Phoenix, Arizona utilizing a Magellan Meridian Gold Handheld GPS to map the perimeter and a Fujifilm FinePix A340 digital camera to take pictures in four directions (N,E,S,W) at every set of coordinates we recorded.  The two largest unburned patches within the perimeter were also mapped, but in less detail.  We also photographed and recorded coordinates for several points of interest including portions of the Max Delta Trail which runs through the burned area, post-fire new growth, and partially burned dominant species.",NULL,NULL

  Complete surveys of the study reach were conducted on 23 dates in 2002 and 19 dates in 2003. Surveys were approximately monthly during winter and more frequent during summer, with survey frequency increasing directly after floods. In addition to complete surveys, a subset of points was also sampled during 6 flood events. Sample locations included inlets and outlets of all lakes between the outlet of L-1 and the outlet of L-8, plus additional inlet and outlet sites for other hydrologic inputs and off-channel components of the system.

"209","Legacies on the landscape: Ecological outcomes of prehistoric agriculture in central Arizona","
<p>Ecologists have realized that many previously-considered ""pristine"" ecosystems have been altered by past land use activities. While large-scale, post-colonial land use changes are expected to some extent to leave an ecological imprint, more surprising has been the discovery that prehistoric human communities, even ones that disappeared from the landscape centuries ago, can have significant impacts on the structure and functioning of modern ecosystems. This research builds upon an ongoing collaboration between ecologists and archaeologists at ASU focused upon the cultural and ecological effects of recursive human-environment interactions. In this work, we are asking, Did prehistoric agricultural activity leave long-lasting impacts on ecological properties and processes?   We are exploring plant communities, deep soil chemistry, and surface water dynamics in two regions of central Arizona that supported agroecologically active and well studied populations of humans until 1200-1400 AD. Our first site is at Cave Creek in the Sonoran desert of the northern Phoenix basin, which supported relatively large human populations for approximately four centuries using both irrigated and dry land farming techniques. Our second site is at Perry Mesa, located at higher elevation in the semi-arid desert grasslands of Agua Fria National Monument (AFNM). Populations at Perry Mesa were smaller and more ephemeral than at Cave Creek, and were supported by only dry land agricultural fields and house gardens.

</p>","<p>Experimental design:  To separate various ecological and anthropogenic drivers of landscape patterns in arid and semi-arid systems, we selected an experimental design that controlled for both prehistoric agricultural activity and presence or absence of rock alignments with four 'landscape types.' To explore the effect of humans/agriculture, we collected soil and plant samples: 1) near (<0.5km) the archeological site (assumed to have relatively high prehistoric human impact) and 2) far (0.5-1km) from the archeological site (assumed to have less human impact). To explore the effects of rock alignments, we collected soil and plant samples: 3) behind the rock alignments where water and soil would collect and 4) from areas with no rock alignments within each 'near' and 'far' location.</p> 

<p><u>Surface soil and annual plant growth.</u>  Fifteen replicates of each landscape type were established at each site. Plots were approximately 4  x 2 m, half of which was used for plant biomass collection while the other half was used for soil sampling. Soil samples were collected three times in 2008 over the period from February to October. Above ground biomass of herbaceous annual plant species was collected at peak growth in the spring (April) and fall (October) of 2008 at AFNM and during the spring (March) at CC to estimate net primary productivity of this plant community.</p> 

<p><u>Deep soil properties and chemistry, and dust deposition</u>.  Using a subset of three replicates from each of the four 'landscape types' described above the AFNM site, we measured soil chemistry and properties from soil pits excavated to bedrock.  We measured dust deposition in 2010 and 2011 at 1-2 m height at 10 locations near archaeological sites at AFNM using passive methods (cake pan with marbles).</p>  

<p><u>Surface rocks and succulent distribution.</u>  One of the primary legacies of prehistoric human activity in the US Southwest was surface rock movement, as these agriculturalists used rocks to build their homes and construct their agricultural fields.  We are exploring the effects of surface rocks on succulent species abundance and composition at AFNM.  Using a topographic map of the region, we randomly chose 6 hilltops located in the NE quadrant of Perry Mesa, bordered by Silver Creek to the north, Bishop Creek to the south, the Agua Fria River to the west and the Tonto National Forest to the east. For the first phase of this work, sites were located > 1 km away from known archaeological sites. On each hilltop, we established one 25 m x 25 m plot (625 m2) with the plot edges aligned N-S and E-W. Within each plot, we measured percent cover of rocks, microhabitat availability (fraction of area within distance categories near rocks), and presence and type of succulents within these microhabitats.</p>  

<p><u>Surface rock effects on soil water content.</u> We are combine modeling and manipulative experimental approaches to ask, how do surface rock characteristics influence plant-available soil water dynamics across seasonal precipitation regimes typical of central Arizona?  We hypothesize that rocks will affect soil water availability most during the summer by moderating runoff and diminishing evaporation during warm daytime temperatures.  We are exploring the effects of rock cover on soil water dynamics by parameterizing and testing a well-known soil water transport model, Hydrus 2D, against empirical data generated from constructed soil boxes in a controlled, outdoor setting using soils from both AFNM and Cave Creek.</p>",NULL

<b>Overview</b>


</p>
<p>

  The primary goals of conservation biology and restoration ecology are to 1) preserve natural habitat and 2) restore disturbed habitats to natural or semi-natural states in order to maintain species diversity, relative abundances, community structure and ecosystem function. Urbanization (and suburbanization) is the most rapidly increasing habitat type, and commensurate with urbanization are often radically changes in species diversity and composition and ecosystem function. Within the urban or suburban matrix of most cities are remnants of once dominant natural habitats. For example, desert remnants and parks are scattered within the CAP LTER region for the purpose of preserving Sonoran desert structure and function. Furthermore, some municipalities mandate desert xeriscaping that mimics outlying deserts in physical form and appearance. In the same vein, restoration efforts have attempted to resurrect once existing habitats (e.g., riparian areas in the Salt River basin). 

</p>
<p>

  '
</p>
<p>

  Our basic question is: Do these desert remnants and reconstructed desert habitats that resemble outlying deserts in vegetation form retain the same structure and function in terms of community and trophic structure and function? This critical question addresses one of the tenets of restoration ecology. Known as the ""Field of Dreams"" hypothesis (Palmer et al. 1997, Hildebrand et al. 2005), it assumes that if you preserve or reconstruct the physical structure for a particular ecosystem, biotic composition, diversity and function will self-assemble, much like the original or targeted ecosystem. This hypothesis is ingrained in restoration ecology, but recently criticized as too simplistic (see Hilderbrand et al. 2005), and moreover rarely tested empirically. We have the unique opportunity to test whether desert remnants and reconstructed habitats are similar in biotic diversity, composition, and function with the existing CAP LTER database. This test has extremely important ramifications for ecology, conservation biology and restoration ecology. If remnants and reconstructed habitats are not equivalent in biotic form and function, then it may not be enough simply to preserve or build habitats. Furthermore, this test will provide insights into the mechanisms of how urbanization alters community composition and trophic function.

<b>Project description</b>


</p>
<p>

  Since CAP LTER started up in 1997/1998, numerous monitoring projects have been initiated to survey factors that influence the urban ecosystem. The scale differs in the surveys, and the focus varies from physical characteristics like groundwater and runoff to biological measures like bird counts, vegetation mapping and arthropod sampling.

</p>
<p>

  Â 

</p>
<p>

  The most extensive field survey is the Survey200 database, where the intention is to sample the entire ecosystem every five years. The large field survey comprises the urbanized, suburbanized and agricultural areas of metropolitan Phoenix and the surrounding desert. Objectives are to characterize patches in terms of key biotic, physical, chemical and socio-economic variables and to examine relationships between land use, general plant diversity, native plant diversity, plant biovolume, soil nutrient status, and socio-economic indices along an indirect urban gradient. One of the strengths of Survey200 lies in the spatial aspect, because the 200 sites cover many different land uses and thus many different habitats (Fig.1). Although the land use is described in detail in the database, the sites can be organized in six categories that will fit our proposed project: Agriculture, outlying desert, desert remnants, mesic yards, xeric yards, and a mixed category (sites consisting of a mixture of landscape uses). A disadvantage of Survey200 is that samples are collected only every five years, leaving a time gap where sites can turn from desert to parking lots. The actual sampled year may be atypical, such as a year of extreme drought or other unusual climatic variability. This makes continuous analyses difficult, and so far with only two sampling years it is hard to draw any conclusions, except from comparing the sites. In addition, the arthropods in Survey200 were sampled with sweepnets, favoring arthropods living in vegetation and basically excluding ground dwelling arthropods from the samples.

</p>
<p>

  Another database initiated in 1998 by CAP scientists is the ground arthropod database, based on quarterly pitfall samples from 46 sites in different locations in the CAP area. This study aims to characterize differences in the types of arthropod species inhabiting different types of patches (e.g., desert remnants, agricultural fields, suburban yards, industrial properties) in different locations throughout the Phoenix metropolitan area. Arthropods provide a key link between what is going on with plant communities (many insects eat plants) and what is going on with vertebrate populations (many birds and lizards eat insects), so characterizing differences in arthropod assemblages as functions of land use and land cover is a key component of understanding the ecology of Phoenix. Arthropods are distributed not only spatially, but also in time due to life history requirements and seasonal adaptations. One major strength of this database is it s continuity with four sampling periods per year, enabling incorporation of seasonal changes in arthropod diversity and relative abundances. A second advantage is that the sampling has been carried out annually from 1998 to 2005, capturing potential variation between years. Another asset is that more than half of the sampling sites overlap with Survey200 sampling sites (Fig.1), allowing a more complete picture of the arthropod communities. One noteworthy problem with this database however, is that some of the sampled sites have been terminated and replaced by other similar sites, due to rapid expansion of the cities  boundaries. Thus, the number of continuous replicates of similar habitat patches is somewhat reduced from the total of 46 sites. This requires cautious treatment of the data throughout the analyses. Also, one other drawback is that pitfalls do not sample flying arthropods and organisms living in trees and shrubby vegetation. However, simultaneous analyses of both databases overcome some of these inevitable shortcomings in sample diverse and abundances communities. For example, Syrvey200 captures mostly arthropods associated with vegetation, while pitfalls sample ground arthropods. Likewise, the broad spatial scale but reduced temporal scale of Survey200 complements the more narrow spatial but broader temporal scale of the pitfall sampling.

</p>
<p>

  By mining each database first separately to sort out irregularities and inconsistencies, we will focus on the aforementioned habitat types/patches to map differences and similarities in arthropod composition and diversity. Then, by combining results from the two databases, focusing on sites overlapping or in the same area with same characteristics (Fig.1), we will have an extensive background for drawing broad conclusions about arthropod community structure in remnant and reconstructed desert habitats relative to outlying deserts. If the â??Field of Dreamsâ? hypothesis holds, we would expect similarities between desert and xeric yards in terms of arthropod diversity, relative abundances and community composition, while we would expect to find the major differences between these two and agriculture and mesic yards.

<b>Previous research</b>


</p>
<p>

  Results from the Survey200 sweepnet samples have not yet been published, mainly because the specimens were recently identified, and that only two years have been sampled so far. Preliminary analyses from the Survey200 database have however revealed interesting results (Fig. 2, left). First, the urban sites, particularly the desert remnants,Â appear much more stable from 2000 to 2005, while their counterparts, the desert sites, fluctuated widely. Second, the desert remnant sites reveal similar guild compositions as the urban sites. The desert remnant category is the only one that does not reveal any difference in predator: herbivore ratio between the two years (Fig. 2, right). The third interesting result is that the urban mesic and urban xeric landscapes do not appear to differ in any of the selected criteria, and thus not supporting the â??Field of Dreamsâ? hypothesis. 

</p>
<p>

  Â 

</p>
<p>

  The sweepnet samples from Survey200 reveal interesting results about how arthropod assemblages vary spatially and temporally, but since we only have two years of samplesso far, caution is advised in making any conclusions. Populations typically fluctuate yearly and seasonally, and we do not know guild ratios or abundance trends in intervening years. Differences in productivity and rainfall in 2000, which was a drought year, to 2005 which received much rainfall during the winter, is a reasonable explanation for the observed fluctuations. The results from between the sites fit well with the idea that urban sites are buffered from seasonal or yearly fluctuations in productivity (Shochat et al. 2004, Faeth et al. 2005, Shochat et al. 2006). A possible explanation for the similar guild structure is that indirect effects from the surrounding urban matrix stabilize relative abundances of guilds. Another explanation is that urban xeric and urban mesic areas are not greatly different in terms of productivity because even xeric yards are often watered (Martin and Stabler 2002). To conclude anything with confidence from these data requires information from intervening years.

</p>
<p>

  Â 

</p>
<p>

  Results from the first year of the arthropod pitfall sampling where published by McIntyre et al. (2001), investigating differences among ground arthropod communities of urban, agricultural, residential, commercial, desert remnant and desert sites and documented seasonal patterns. They concluded that the arthropods responded most strongly to habitat structure, vegetation, air temperature and secondarily to land use. A second publication focusing on the 1998-2001 data concludes that arthropod communities in xeric residential yards do not strongly resemble desert communities, although the habitats seem superficially similar (Cook and Faeth 2006, in press). This is another nail in the coffin for the â??Field of Dreamsâ? hypothesis. 

</p>
<p>

  The two databases described clearly have their pros and cons, but analyzed together they complement each other, giving us a golden opportunity to test our hypotheses for arthropod communities in urban ecosystems. Many restoration projects based on the â??Field of Dreamsâ? hypothesis are not successful either in structure or function when compared with reference or function (Hildebrand et al. 2005), raising a demand for better programs for habitat restoration. Governments, municipalities and NGOs invest quite a lot of resources into landscaping practices that do not give the wanted result. By addressing what is working and what is not, resources could be applied where they have the optimal effect. We expect that our results from this project will be extremely important and suitable for publishing in a high profile journal such as Science, Nature or PNAS. This will also add an important chapter to Christofer Bang s doctoral thesis where he focuses on trophic dynamics in urban ecosystems. We also expect that the National Science Foundation (NSF) will appreciate more publications from these extensive long term surveys, and we will be happy to give a presentation for NSF when they visit CAP in September 2007.

  We will locate and utilize avian point count data from various sources (CAP-LTER, AZGFD, etc.), as well as spending a considerable amount of time in the field collecting point count data that will supplement existing data.  These data will be used to calculate measures of avian species richness in a dozen mountain preserves in the Phoenix metropolitan area.  We will analyze the richness data in relation to vegetation data for the mountain preserves that are already available and landscape pattern characteristics such as distance to urban centers and habitat connectivity.  We are particularly interested in addressing the following research questions: (1) How does urbanization affect the overall avian species diversity in the mountain preserves?  (2) How does urbanization affect different nesting and foraging guilds that may in turn influence avian diversity?  (3) Do birds use the mountain preserves as a system of habitats, thus forming a functional metapopulation?  Or are they simply isolated populations that are highly subjected to local extinction?

</p>

  The field methods we will used are well-developed and used in similar studies elsewhere (e.g., a series of studies carried out by the University of Washington group led by John Marzluff who is currently a collaborator of Wu on an NSF funded project and will be consulted whenever necessary for this proposed work).  Landscape pattern analysis will be carried out using well-established methods, including both landscape metrics and spatial statistics.  We expect that this research will produce a couple of quite interesting and important publications, and the new dataset will be contributed to the CAPLTER database.

  This project will conduct research as originally described in the CAP2 proposal to NSF as part of the ''material flux and socio-ecosystem response'' Integrated Project Area. It builds on previous LTER funded research from a summer 2006 project by Bolin and Boone comparing the sociospatial distributions of hazardous industries (TRI) in the CAP-LTER and BES study areas. This new project has three primary research questions: 1. How do anthropogenic toxins and other hazards vary spatially and sociodemographically in the Phoenix Metropolitan area. 2. How do environmental amenities vary spatially and sociodemographically in the metro region? 3. Is there a relationship between residents'' perceptions of local environmental conditions and objective sociospatial indices of hazards and environmental amenities in PASS neighborhoods?

</p>

","
<p>

  

</p>
<p>

  Question 1 will involve constructing a cumulative hazard density index using a spatial methodology developed by the Environmental Risk Group during CAP1 (Bolin et al., 2002). However, we will move beyond previous riskscape mapping projects by combining new data sets and environmental hazard sources. As in previous risk mapping studies, we include toxic industrial emissions as per the latest EPA Toxic Release Inventory data. To assess health hazards to humans, we will use the EPA''s Risk Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI) data which estimates the health threat industrial emissions using both toxicological assessments and a fate and transport model to characterize overall emissions risk. Our hazard index will also utilize an air pollution model (yet to be selected) for criteria air pollutants to examine sociodemographic variations in the distributions of ambient air pollutants (e.g. Grineski, Bolin and Boone, forthcoming). We will also select other indicators of environmental disamenities including noise contour maps (e.g. around airports) and proximity to major transportation corridors. Lastly, we will we incorporate spatially specific toxics data from other LTER projects, as appropriate. For example Nash and Sweat have conducted lichen heavy metal studies with good spatial resolution in the metro region. Those studies along with Shock''s soil trace element distribution study will provide additional on the ground measures of toxics to supplement the emissions and air pollution data, thus linking point source hazards and ambient air pollution data with ecosystem measures.

</p>
<p>

  

</p>
<p>

  The second research questions requires assembling data to develop an environmental amenities index. Environmental amenities will be measured using a selection of indicators including some derived as part of research described above. We anticipate calculating a ''clean'' air amenity value for tracts with the lowest ambient air pollution score (based on criteria air pollution models) and zero scores on the cumulative hazard index described above. Another element in this index will be based on neighborhood proximity to place-based environmental amenities including parks, recreation facilities, schools with playing fields, and other open spaces. We will use a buffer approach around public facilities and open spaces to assign amenity scores to proximate census tracts (e.g. within .5 km). However, since many parks and recreational facilities in the region are private, exclusionary, and available only to residents, for those neighborhoods we will assign amenity scores based on the specific spatial boundaries of the development/neighborhood association.

</p>
<p>

  

</p>
<p>

  Using the spatial methodology developed by the Environmental Risk Group, a cumulative hazard density and a cumulative amenity density index will be developed to rank census tracts. By developing both an amenity and a disamenity index, we will be able to statistically analyze differences among census tracts with high and low values on each to assess overall patterns of environmental in/equities in the metro region.

</p>
<p>

  

</p>
<p>

  Question 3 will be answered by using the two sociospatial indices to score PASS neighborhoods. We will then analyze the relationship between select respondent environmental perception questions on the survey and the amenity/disamenity scores for their specific neighborhoods. This will allow us to assess the relationship between place-based index scores and the environmental perceptions and concerns of residents in different PASS neighborhoods. Previous research has shown that there is often a disjuncture between people''s risk perceptions and objective risk indicators. This phase of the research will provide a basis for detailed examination of these relationships.

</p>
<p>

  Project Personnel and Budget: This project involves data mining: specifically, obtaining appropriate data sets and combining data into the previously described hazard and amenity indices for mapping and statistical analyses. Most of the hazard data sets are either already held by LTER or are readily available from the EPA or other public interest entities. To carry out the research we are requesting funding to support one Ph.D. level Research Assistant for the 2007-2008 academic year at 20 hours per week.  We have not identified an appropriate candidate yet for this position. The two PIs will direct the research assistant and participate in all other aspects of the project. We are also requesting travel funds to cover anticipated in-state travel in the metro area for research activities ($400) and graduate student travel to one professional meeting to present findings from the research ($750).

</p>
<p>

  RA tasks: The RA will engage in a specific set of tasks over the course of the year. The first will be to assemble anthropogenic hazard data bases and obtain air pollution models for the Phoenix region. The second will be to integrate data sets into an appropriate GIS and to develop the cumulative hazard index. Acquiring on environmental amenities will be more time intensive as these data will have to be assembled from a variety of public sources. We anticipate that collecting and assembling the data sets and developing the environmental indices will occur in Fall semester ''07. Data analysis and writing up results will occur in Spring ''08.

  Introduction

</p>
<p>

  Assessment of long-term air pollution patterns by instrumentation can often be difficult.'Monitoring of pollutants over time can be resource intensive, and data collection with sampling devices needs to start years before analysis can begin.Â Â  The use of living organisms as biomonitors is one method to overcome some of the drawbacks of monitoring air pollution over extended time periods.Â  

</p>
<p>

  As long-lived, slow-growing organisms, lichens are useful as surrogate receptors in atmospheric deposition monitoring investigations, where the integration of long-term signals requires monitoring (Nash 1989, Garty 2001). Because they do not possess nutrient absorbing roots, as found in vascular plants, they have a major dependence on atmospheric sources of nutrients (Nieboer et al. 1978, Nieboer and Richardson 1980). Compared to soil nutrient pools, atmospheric concentrations of nutrients are quite low, and consequently nutrient concentrating mechanisms, such as particulate trapping (Garty et al. 1979), uptake to cell wall exchange sites or transport intracellularly (Beckett and Brown 1984; Brown and Beckett 1985), sequestering in complexes formed with lichen secondary metabolites (Purvis et al. 1987), or impaction of aerosols (Knops et al. 1996) are characteristic of lichens.Â  As a consequence, lichens have often been used to document atmospheric deposition of radionuclides (e.g. Palmer et al. 1965, Seaward et al. 1988, Biazrov 1994) and various other atmospheric pollutants (Puckett 1988, Nash and Gries 1995). When an appropriate stratified sampling design (e.g. with respect to lichen species choice, microhabitat characteristics, atmospheric exposure, etc.) is employed, then both local and regional deposition patterns are readily discerned (Bruteig 1993, Loppi and Bargagli 1996, Muir et al. 1993, Nash 1996), although care must be taken in the assessment of baseline levels (Gough et al. 1988; Bennett 2000).

</p>
<p>

  In an earlier investigation supported by ASU s CAP-LTER (Zschau et al. 2003), we determined past spatial patterns of atmospheric deposition across Maricopa County, Arizona, in 1998, based on samples from 28 sites, as analyzed by ICP-MS. One long-term objective of CAP-LTER is to resurvey the same area every 7-8 years, and consequently lichen samples were collected in 2006.

</p>
<p>

  The county is approximately L-shaped, extending over 200 km along its two longer axes, and contains the Phoenix metropolitan area, one of the fastest growing urban regions in the world. Although heavy industry is minimal within the Phoenix area, Arizona has historically been an important source of copper.Â  Major sources of spatial elemental variationÂ  included copper mining (Maricopa Co. and especially Pinal and Gila Cos.) and smelting (Pinal and Gila Cos.), anthropogenic sources associated with the urban center (e.g. lead, vanadium) and location of special geological features, such as mafic rocks with elevated concentrations of Co, Cr, Ni, and Sc relative to average abundances in the Earth s crust. In addition, temporal comparisons for six of the same sites within the county were possible, based on collections made in the mid-1970 s (Nash et al. 2003), where sufficient lichen material was available for analysis. Decreases in copper (cessation of smelting) and lead (switch to unleaded gasoline) were demonstrable and increases in zinc were found (Zschau et al. 2003).Â  Other research has demonstrated that trace metals are detected in lichens near a coal power plant (Olmez et al., 1985) and in lichens transplanted to the region of a coal power plant (Garty and Hagemeyer, 1988).

  Goals

</p>
<p>

  The overall objective is to document the spatial pattern of past elemental deposition as reflected in lichens (
Xanthoparmelia
 spp.) as of 2006 within the region encompassing the greater metropolitan Phoenix area (Maricopa County) and, where possible, to determine historical trends in comparison to patterns documented in previous work (Zschau et al., 2003). In the process we anticipate being able to accomplish the following: 

</p>
<p>

  1.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Determine patterns of elemental deposition patterns (Cu, Ag, As, etc.) associated with the various pollution sources that impact the area.

</p>
<p>

  2.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Determine existing vanadium deposition patterns (associated with vehicles). 

</p>
<p>

  3.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Determine lead deposition patterns (associated with historic uses with vehicles). 

</p>
<p>

  4.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Determine any changes in deposition patterns from previous research in Maricopa county (Zschau et al., 2003).

</p>
<p>

  5.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Based on separate analytical procedures in collaboration with Dr. Paul Gremillion at NAU, determining Hg levels for the first time.

</p>
<p>

  To accomplish these objectives we collected 
Xanthoparmelia
 spp. in May to June, 2006, at 30 field sites (with triplicates at each site) at the locations used in previous research. Sample preparation has consumed much of the summer and fall (2006), and digestions of the samples in Dr. Shock s laboratory will be completed in the spring (2007). Dr. Shock and Dr. P. Praipapong will supervise Mr. Sweat in the HR-ICP-MS analyses of the digested samples during the late spring or early summer (2007). Mr. Sweat will be responsible for data reduction and analysis under Dr. Nash s and Dr. Shock s direction (starting summer 2007). Interpretation of the results and writing of publications will be done jointly by the student and Drs. Nash, and Shock. Publications will include spatial plots for at least 10 elements related to anthropogenic activities up to 2006, and will include historical trends to the extent possible. 

</p>
<p>

  Methods

</p>
<p>

  The genus 
Xanthoparmelia
 is selected as the most suitable biomonitor of metal deposition in metropolitan Phoenix region, because it is one of the few macrolichens (readily obtaining enough material for analysis is critical) in arid areas (Nash et al. 1977), is easily recognizable in the field, and has already been used for similar investigations (Zschau et al. 2003; Nash et al. 2003). Spatial patterns of atmospheric deposition of trace elements to these epilithic lichens will be assessed using the locations of the Zschau et al. (2003) study with two additional sites added to this research. Â 

</p>
<p>

  The lichens were removed from the substrate with plastic tweezers, cleaned and homogenized.Â  A subsample from each lichen has also been analyzed for mercury with a mercury analyzer (fall 2006).Â  Subsamples of the remaining lichen material (n=3) will be wet digested and analyzed by HP-ICP-MS for a suite of elemental concentrations (antimony [Sb], cadmium [Cd], cerium [Ce], chromium [Cr], cobalt [Co], copper [Cu], dysprosium [Dy], europium [Eu], gadolinium [Gd], gold [Au], holmium [Ho], lead [Pb], lutetium [Lu], neodymium [Nd], nickel [Ni], palladium [Pd], platinum [Pt], praseodymium [Pr], samarium [Sm], scandium [Sc], silver [Ag], terbium [Tb], thulium [Tm], tin [Sn], uranium [U], vanadium [V], ytterbium [Yb], yttrium [Y], and zinc [Zn]). Elements for which mass interferences can be a problem during ICP analysis (e.g. As, Fe) will be cross-checked with atomic absorption spectroscopy.

</p>
<p>

  In the laboratory, lichen thalli of approximately 6-8 cm in diameter were selected, removed from the rock substrate with plastic forceps, rinsed and cleaned thoroughly using nano-pure water. This cleaning step was conducted in a laminar flow unit to limit potential contamination from the prep person.Â  The cleaned thalli are stored in nitric acid-washed polypropylene bottles until air-dry. To minimize intra-thalline and inter-thalline elemental variation at each sampling site (Loppi and Bargagli 1996), the lichen material were homogenized in a ball mill. Previous experiments tested elemental recoveries of different digestion procedures (Zschau et al. 2003).Â  Preliminary digestions of lichen standards (IAEA 336) determined that conventional wet digestion procedures, using concentrated nitric acid, hydrofluoric acid and hydrochloric acid digestion, was the best procedure.Â  The accuracy of the digestion procedure will be checked against the lichen standard IAEA 336 obtained from the International Atomic Energy Agency.

</p>
<p>

  All labware were cleaned for 72 h in a 10% nitric acid bath, and then rinsed three times in nanopure water to minimize metal contamination. Lichen material from each location were subdivided into three replicates of 0.1 g each (oven dry weight), and transferred into heavy duty vessels appropriate for use in a microwave digestion oven (Mars 5, CM).Â  Wet oxidation will be (has been) induced by addition of 9 ml of concentrated HNO
<sub>3</sub>
, 0.5 ml of concentrated HF, and 1 ml of concentrated HCl.Â  The samples will be (have been) heated over 20 minutes to 180 Â°C in the Mars 5 microwave digester, held at 180 Â°C for ten minutes, and then allowed to cool to under 50 Â°C before venting the vessel.Â  This suspension containing the free metals will be then gravimetrically brought to a volume of 25 ml and used for analysis.Â  A similar protocol has been successfully used for mercury residues in food (Entwisle, 2004).Â  

</p>
<p>

  Before quantitative analysis (ICP), samples will be spiked with indium (selected because it is mono-isotopic, near the middle of the mass range, and not an element of interest to this study) as an internal calibration standard. Elemental concentrations for a suite of 28 trace metals in each sample will be quantified using high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS).Â  To reduce potential interferences and analysis time, the HR-ICP-MS will be run in the peak jump mode counting at key masses per element and scanning only for a select number of isotopes. Â Blanks will be run along the entire sample preparation procedure and should be uniformly much lower than the replicates from the same location.

</p>
<p>

  Means of the triplicate, independent digestions per location and their respective standard deviations will be calculated. These parameters and the original data will be made available at http//ces.asu.edu. Using the PC-ORD software (McCune and Mefford 1999), two methods will be employed to examine spatial patterns of elemental concentration of those elements that were above detection levels at all sites. First, the data matrix for the cluster analysis (Ward s method) will be transformed to the sums of standard deviations to reduce the amount of chaining present in the groupings of locations and elements.Â  Results will be graphed in the form of dendrograms.Â  Second, principal component analysis (PCA) and alternatively NMS (non-metric multidimentional scaling) will be used to reduce dimensionality and explain the main sources of variation. Normal probability plots for each principal component will be used to assess the underlying assumption of normality. The final results of the PCA s and NMS s will be graphed as two- or three-dimensional ordination plots. Furthermore, the results of the PCA s can be further refined by factor analysis to help identify elemental source (e.g. Sloof 1995; Rahn and Huanh 1999).

</p>
<p>

  Surface maps for concentrations of at least cadmium, lead, copper, nickel, and zinc will be interpolated among the 50 locations using ArcGIS Geostatistics and Spatial Analyst packages.Â  All data files will be converted into UTM 1983, zone 12 format, which offers the best map projection of the target.Â  The following ArcGIS Geostatistics settings are anticiptated to best resolve the spatial pollution patterns (based on Zschau et al. 1999), and will, therefore, be used to interpolate the surfaces:

</p>
<p>

  1. Interpolation Mode:Â  Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW).Â  The interpolator assumes that input points have a local influence that decreases with distance.

</p>
<p>

  2. Interpolator settings:Â  spatial resolution 300 map units, nearest neighbor analysis, 20 points, power = 5, and no barriers. Other workers (Gailey et al. 1985) have modeled pollution patterns using a 4th order polynomial fit.

</p>
<p>

  The interpolated surfaces will be clipped to the target regions borders using GIS data from the Arizona Land Resource Information System (ALRIS).Â  Geology, topology, traffic, urbanization, and mining activities will be also evaluated using ALRIS and USGS DEM maps.Â  Historical industrial emissions for some elements will be collected from the toxic release inventory (TRI) from the US Environmental Protection Agency, and spatial localities indexed to the interpolated maps. 

</p>
<p>

  Because the 
Xanthoparmelia
 grows on rocks, part of the elemental variation observed in the area will doubtlessly be related to underlying variation in geology and associated blowing dust. Accordingly, it will be necessary to interpret the results in terms of basic knowledge of geochemistry (e.g. Levinson 1974; Taylor and McLennan 1985) as well as specific knowledge of the geochemistry in the region (e.g. Reynolds 1988; Titley and Anthony 1989). Because known pollution sources are present in the region, the results will also have to be interpreted in light of known emission data (e.g. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1997).

</p>
<p>

  Budget 

</p>
<p>

  Summer salary only is sought for the student, Mr. Ken Sweat, to complete work with an emphasis on analysis and interpretation during the summer of 2007. Mr. Sweat is a Ph.D. candidate in SoLS and a lecturer at ASU West. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â

Relationship of Project to CAP LTER
 . I am requesting support for a summer graduate RA to assist in analyzing aspects of 2006 Phoenix Area Social Survey (PASS) and allied data sets. PASS is a CAP LTER project-wide activity that relates to all of the IPAs and the proposed summer project will relate specifically to the Land-Use and Land-Cover Change IPA, for which a key question is:  
How do land-use and land-cover changes alter the ecological and social environment in the city?


</p>
<p>

   

</p>
<p>

  The value of this multi-level neighborhood/household survey to CAP LTER lies in both the social data that tell us about the people who live in the Phoenix metropolitan area and about variations in the neighborhood socioecological systems studied by ecologists, social scientists, climatologists, and other CAP scientists.  LTER s goals for 2006 PASS are to: 1) establish baseline data for long-term social monitoring of environmental perceptions, values, knowledge and behavior that transform the ecosystem in the study region; 2) achieve a higher degree of integration between studies of social behavior and studies of the biophysical environment in the study region; 3) examine how socioeconomic inequalities are related to spatial variations in ecosystem characteristics; and 4) study the effects of environmental feedbacks to the comfort, health, and well-being of diverse social groups who share the urban environment.

</p>

","
<p>

  
Study Design:
 '006 PASS builds upon the long-term ecological monitoring strategy of Survey 200. The sampling frame for PASS neighborhoods is the Survey 200, which was designed to obtain a spatially dispersed, unbiased sample of 204 points across all main land use types in the CAP LTER area.Â  PASS neighborhoods are co-located with some Survey 200 sites in order to take advantage of spatially-referenced datasets that can be used to understand the social context of the sites and the ecology of the neighborhoods. Our analysis of the sites using an overlay of 2000 U.S. Census block group boundaries and field visits established that 94 of the sites were in close proximity to neighborhoods in 2005.Â  The sample of 40 PASS neighborhoods was selected (from 94 possibilities) to represent diversity in community socioeconomic status, racial/ethnic composition, age of population, housing types, and core-suburban-fringe location. One resident from at least 20 randomly selected housing units in each of the 40 block groups responded to the PASS survey, which produced a sample size of 808 respondents (response rate = 51 percent).Â  Thus, the PASS database can be analyzed at multiple spatial scales:Â  individual housing units, neighborhoods, and metropolitan region.Â 

</p>
<p>

  
Current Project Status
:Â  Data collection for the survey was completed by the Institute for Social Science Research in late September 2006 and data editing and cleaning is nearly finished as of this writing.Â  (We have been working with a preliminary data set since October.)Â  Work performed by Ruddell and others since last summer will enable us to link biophysical data to the neighborhoods and household surveys. To date we have a US 2000 Census database at the block group level for PASS neighborhoods, the Maricopa County Tax Assessor 2005 parcel data, which contains variables on home and lot characteristics, and an object-oriented classification scheme for woody vegetation (Walker and Briggs 2005). Bird monitoring sites have been changed to match PASS neighborhoods and we are working on getting 2006 LULC classifications, which will enable fine-scale modeling of weather events and other analyses.Â  PASS researchers have outlined initial plans for several analyses, a new NSF proposal incorporating PASS data was submitted in November, and Ruddell is planning to use PASS in his Ph.D. dissertation.

</p>
<p>

  
*Proposed Summer Project
.Â  We propose to advance the fundamental goals of PASS/CAP LTER â?? integrating studies of social and biophysical environments, examining inequalities in socioecological systems, and studying environmental feedbacks to human well-being â?? by undertaking a summer project that analyzes the effects of the biophysical environment in public spaces on actual crime rates and people s perceptions of neighborhood safety in PASS communities.Â  

</p>
<p>

  Â 

</p>
<p>

  Since the Morrison Institute began its quality of life surveys in 1997, Phoenix area residents have consistently ranked â??public safety and crimeâ? among the top three issues that matter most for a good quality of life in the Valley (Morrison 2004).Â  The social science literature on environment and crime demonstrates that built and ecological environments in publicly accessible places have strong effects on crime rates in neighborhoods (e.g., Brownlow 2006; Kuo and Sullivan 2001; Perkins et al. 1993; Rotten and Cohn 2004).Â  Nonresidential urban land uses, in particular the presence of parks and playgrounds, increase residents perceptions of danger as well as reported crime rates (Wilcox et al. 2003).Â  This effect is pronounced in lower-income central city areas. In the pilot 2001 PASS study, 30 percent of residents in low-income neighborhoods reported that city parks were â??too closeâ? to them compared to only 10 percent in middle-income neighborhoods and no one in upper-income neighborhoods (Harlan et al. 2003). Brownlow (2006) theorizes that an â??ecology of fearâ? about urban parks affects central city residents who perceive disorder in physical deterioration (e.g., trash, graffiti, drug objects) and also in the replacement of native ecological systems that are depleted in biodiversity and replaced by â??weedâ? based ecologies due to environmental stressors of urbanization.Â  In the proposed project, we will address the following research questions.Â  
Does the ecology of parks mediate the effects of neighborhood social environment on crime rates and residents  perceptions of crime rates?Â  How do park ecology, social environment, and crime affect residents  perceptions of the quality of parks and common spaces within or adjacent to the boundaries of PASS neighborhoods?


</p>
<p>

  Â 

</p>
<p>

  Data will be compiled in four primary steps.Â  First, we will map the areas of public land uses that are within or adjacent to the boundaries of PASS neighborhoods by using the 2006 LULC classification database.Â  This will serve as the study area for our research.Â  Utilizing a dataset on reported crimes for MaricopaCounty cities 1996-2005, the second step will be to map the location and types of crime that occurred recently within the public spaces of our study area, giving particular attention to parks and recreational spaces.Â  While literature indicates that criminal offenders consciously select crime sites (Laukkanen and Santtila 2006), this research will offer insight into the types of crimes that are being committed in parks and recreational spaces and if there is a relationship between crimes and landscape ecology.Â  This leads to the third step which will be to develop spatially-specific ecological indicators of the abundance and diversity of vegetation within the parks that fall within the study area.Â  For example, we will classify the predominant landscape (mesic, xeric, native, etc.) and assess tree coverage for all of the parks within the study area by collaborating with ecologists on the PASS research team.Â  In order to accomplish this objective, we will examine the best available aerial photos as well as conduct field work and ground-truthing.Â  The fourth and final step will be to develop measures of the social context of PASS neighborhoods based on location (core urban area, suburban areas, and urban fringe), sociodemographic variables (socioeconomic status, ethnic composition, and age), and social environment of the neighborhood (social ties, trust, neighborhood satisfaction, etc.). These indicators will be used in the analysis of survey responses on perceptions of residents about disorder, crime, and the quality of parks and common spaces in their neighborhoods.

</p>
<p>

  Two techniques will be employed to analyze the data.Â  Following the traditional Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) global regression model, spatial variations and heterogeneity in the relationships will be examined by using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), a newly developed statistical methodology specifically designed to deal with spatial non-stationarity among regressed relationships (Yu 2004).Â  Statistics provided by GWR offer an explanation on local variation by providing a multi-value statistic for each location.Â  Residents  perception of parks is not uniform across PASS neighborhoods and GWR provides empirical evidence indicating which neighborhoods are more vulnerable along with which indicators contribute to public perception. Results from GWR will indicate the degree to which variables contribute to public perception as well as indicate which neighborhoods exhibit positive or negative attitude toward quality of parks and common spaces.

</p>
<p>

  This interdisciplinary project will involve other members of the PASS research team.Â  In particular we will consult with Paige Warren and Jason Walker.Â  Paige was involved with CAP LTER s â??parksâ? project and she is familiar with many parks in the area, the previous survey on residents  use of parks, and avian diversity in parks.Â  Jason has developed two object-oriented vegetation classification schemes based on high resolution aerial photography and can advise us on constructing spatially-specific vegetation indicators for assessing parks and recreational spaces.Â  This project will address an important question about public land use as it relates to the varied nature of ecological and social neighborhoods in the study area and the implications for human quality of life. The project is also important because CAP LTER social scientists (Boone, Harlan) are considering the expansion of research on environmental equity to include park access as an environmental amenity.Â  Given that park environments are apparently not equally safe and appealing to residents, the proposed study will help us to determine the conditions under which parks are amenities or disamenities to neighborhood residents.

</p>
<p>

  
<b>2) Specific Duties of the RA.</b>


</p>
<p>

  Ruddell will be responsible for compiling the land use and crime data for the study.Â  Using GIS he will overlay these datasets with ecological indicators for the parks developed in collaboration with Warren and Walker.Â  He will merge these data with the PASS survey, which will be analyzed with GWR in collaboration with Harlan.Â  We anticipate that this analysis will result in a publishable article.

</p>
<p>

  
<b>3) Qualifications of Darren Ruddell</b>


</p>
<p>

  Ruddell has served as the PASS RA for two years where he has been directly involved in all phases of the research: preparation for selecting study sites, survey instrument design and implementation, as well as data analysis. Â During this time, Ruddell has contributed to the study in a variety of ways: conducting field research (onsite evaluations, collecting digital photographs of neighborhoods, delivering doorknob hangers to the sample population, and field verification) as well as collecting and organizing materials for the study (e.g., census data for demographic evaluation of neighborhoods, maps of study area retrieved from census, enumeration of plat maps, preparing aerial photographs for each neighborhood, metadata on block groups).Â  

</p>
<p>

  In addition to his role and familiarity with the PASS research project, Ruddell has taken a variety of courses on GIS.Â  For a class research project he completed a paper, â??Crime, Property Value, and Geographically Weighted Regression: A Case Study on Scottsdale, AZ,â? that has not only generated an interest in crime analysis, but has also strengthened the qualifications necessary for him to conduct this research.Â  

</p>
<p>

  
<b>4) Amount of Time Requested</b>


</p>
<p>

  We request support for five pay periods in summer 2007.

"233","An Ethnohydrologic Evaluation of Water Quality and Quantity in CAP","
<p>
The Phoenix Ethnohydrology Study is a follow-up study to the DCDC/LTER-funded Phoenix Area Social Survey II (PASS II), a 40-neighborhood survey conducted in greater Phoenix in the summer of 2006. Based on respondents’ assessment of water quality in their neighborhood in PASS II, we selected a sub-sample of four neighborhoods for additional in-depth study. The goal of Year 1 research (2007-2008) was to assess the public’s perception of water quality using innovative methods for understanding local ecological knowledge (LEK). Research in Year 2 (2008-2008) will broaden the scope of the Year 1 research to (1) match Year 1 data on water quality perceptions to the chemical content of drinking water, (2) investigate perceptions of water sources and scarcity, and (3) compare perceptions of water quality collected in Year 1 to data from Spanish-speakers in Phoenix as well as populations in Bolivia, New Zealand, and Fiji.
</p>

","
<p>

  
<b>Project Goal</b>


</p>
<p>

  Assess the public s perception of water quality and attempt to determine the spatial differences in key drinking (and other water use)'ater quality parameters across the CAP LTER study area.

</p>
<p>

  
<b>Project Approach</b>


</p>
<p>

  The project will mainly involve water-specific surveys and their data interpretation.Â  Therefore, the graduate student will have expertise in this area.Â  However, the researchers will also have the student work with CAP-LTER data mining personnel and DCDC to collect and map spatial and annual patterns in drinking water and wastewater quality.Â  Surveys will be conducted with participants from regions in the CAP study area which have quantitatively different water quality to determine if relationships between perception and actual water quality exist.

</p>
<p>

  
Phase I


</p>
<p>

  Data from the PASS2 survey related to water will be analyzed in detail.Â  One question was: Q28b. Now, thinking only about your neighborhood, are you very, somewhat, not too or not at all concerned about... Safety of the drinking water? [RANDOMIZED]

</p>

<ol>
<li>


     Very concerned
  

</li>
<li>


    Somewhat concerned
  

</li>
<li>


    Not too concerned
  

</li>
<li>


    Not at all concerned
  

</li>
<li>


    Don''t know
  

</li>
<li>


     Refuse to answer
  

</li>
</ol>

<p>

  Duration: 1 month

</p>
<p>

  
Phase II


</p>
<p>

  Figure 1 illustrates the location of surveys for PASS2.Â  Data mining from ADEQ and individual cities (mandatory annual water quality reports for drinking water) will be guided to obtain key water quality parameters that may vary spatially:

</p>
<p>

  For Drinking water:

</p>

<ul>
<li>


    Conductance
  

</li>
<li>


    Hardness
  

</li>
<li>


    Temperature
  

</li>
<li>


    Chlorine residual
  

</li>
<li>


    Nitrogen speciation
  

</li>
<li>


    Number and type of regulatory violations
  

</li>
</ul>

<p>

  -Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  For wastewater:

</p>

<ul>
<li>


    Conductance
  

</li>
<li>


    Hardness
  

</li>
<li>


    Nitrogen speciation
  

</li>
<li>


    Temperature
  

</li>
</ul>

<p>

  Â Data for the last 2-5 years will be spatially mapped.Â  It is anticipated that some of this data could also be integrated into DCDC to better visualize spatial water quality differences.

</p>
<p>

  Duration: 2 months intensive + ongoing for several months

</p>
<p>

  Â 

</p>
<p>

  
Phase III


</p>
<p>

  Based upon overlays of Figure 1 with new maps for water quality and responses from the PASS2 survey, the main part of the RA request will be to create a andldquocognitive mapandrdquo of how people perceive the natural environment, as related to water.Â  This may become a template for additional studies on other stressors (e.g., air).Â  Specifically, this is an ethnohydrologic study of Phoenix. Ethnohydrologic studies are designed to create a andldquocognitive mapandrdquo of how people perceive the natural environment, the way it functions, and how it relates to human systems. The research begins with an inductive phase, in which the researcher catalogues the breadth of people s cultural knowledge of an ecological domain (in this case, water quality, water sources, and water scarcity). The method used for this phase is called andldquofree listingandrdquo.Â  Once the researcher has amassed an exhaustive catalogue of environmental terms, respondents are asked to do a set of systematic evaluations of the ethnohydrological domains called ""triad tests"". Using the results of triad tests, a cultural consensus analysis can be conducted, which tests the extent to which cultural knowledge is shared across the population. Additionally, each participant can be given a score that assesses their cultural proficiency.

</p>
<p>

  Â 

</p>
<p>

  The research can be conducted with approximately 80 short interviews (40 free lists and 40 triad tests). For a small summer project, it may be most fruitful to focus on one urban micro-environment. Alternatively, a very interesting study could be a comparison of ethnohydrologic knowledge between English-speaking and Spanish-speaking residents of Phoenix.

</p>
<p>

  Â 

</p>
<p>

  By collecting data on demographics and PASS Q 28b during the ethnohydrologic interviews, we could determine what it really means when Phoenix residents say that they are andldquoconcernedandrdquo about water quality and water scarcity. Together, the large-n PASS survey results combined with in-depth research on knowledge would provide a thorough assessment about public perceptions of water quality and water scarcity.Â  These data, when supplemented with data on water quality and scarcity, can tell us a great deal about the need for water-related public education and outreach in metropolitan Phoenix.

"234","Modeling fluxes of water and salt through the urban infrastructure","
<p>

  
<b>Background</b>


</p>
<p>

  Whereas previous water-research efforts at CAP LTER have focused upon water and landscape management and a preliminary water budget for the metro area, we recognize a need for a more complex hydrologic cycle, with natural variability altered by the need to supply water for human activities and protect from floods. Controlled management activities shift the characteristic spatial and temporal variability of the system, leading to ecological consequences, human perceptions of change, and further institutional responses. This pattern can lead to vulnerabilities and unanticipated ecological consequences, inability to recognize key processes, and reduced capacity to withstand perturbations.  

</p>
<p>

   

</p>
<p>

  A RA was funded within engineering during the 2006-2007 AY to model fluxes of water and salt through the urban infrastructure.  The model is based upon the same platform as used by DCDC (PowerSim) with the intent to be able to integrate the models to provide a spatially explicit understanding of water and salt fluxes.  The project team decided to focus on a single municipality (City of Scottsdale) which has all the components of a modern arid-region urban water infrastructure system: supply of water from Colorado River through Central Arizona Project (CAP), groundwater, surface water (SRP), rainfall, runoff, wastewater, and reclaimed water.   Data mining and generalized models are currently being integrated to support the model (Figure 1).  In all regards the project is successful and will achieve the goal of modeling these fluxes through a single city.  

</p>

","
<p>

  There is a need to expand the spatial resolution of the water and salt flux model from a single city to a larger spatial scale.'Currently the water and salt flux model is designed to accept either discrete data (from data mining) or simple algorithms that represent appropriate patterns of water supply/use/precipitation, etc.Â  These activities meet the goals outlined in the Continuing Research portion of the CAP2 proposal related to data mining, modeling and hydrologic budgets.

</p>
<p>

  We propose to have a graduate student to first replicate the model for a different city (e.g., Goodyear) located at the urban fringe and which has less access to surface water and is forced to use more low quality (high salt content) groundwater.Â  Furthermore, the city has less infrastructure and treatment capabilities.Â  Because the basic modeling framework is established this activity can be achieved within the first semester.

</p>
<p>

  During the second semester, the student will explore the potential to regionalize the water and salt flux model and how it can be integrated into DCDC activities.Â  Thus, the model will provide spatial resolution to analyze water and salt fluxes across the CAP study area, and within the study area at different scales.

</p>
<p>

  Based upon the progress made to date and the research during the first semester, we anticipate preparation of a peer-reviewed journal publication on this urban water systems modeling.

"236","The behavior, ecology and evolution of the Western black widow (Latrodectus hesperus):  from desert predators to urban pests","
<p>

  The aim of this project is to develop a thorough understanding of the interaction between black widow behavior and population ecology that results in colonization and population establishment/growth in urban habitats.  
The focus throughout this project will be on comparing the behavior, ecology and population genetics of urban widow populations collected in Phoenix with populations from surrounding desert habitat.
  What behavioral differences have arisen between these relatively recently diverged populations?  For example, are spiders from urban environments, on average, bolder or shyer towards predators than spiders from desert habitats?  Is this boldness the result of different predation regimes experienced across the population types?  In other words, does the interaction between behavior (e.g. boldness towards predators) and ecology (e.g. degree of predation risk) explain the explosive success of urban widow spiders?  Similar questions will be asked regarding population differences in the behavioral ecology surrounding foraging, mating, agonism and parental care.  

</p>
<p>

  What can genetic variation within and between these populations tell us about the success of urban populations?  The study of non-native species introductions has emphasized the importance of reduced genetic variation that typically accompanies the colonization of new habitats by only a few introduced individuals.  Do urban populations show evidence of low levels of genetic variation similar to that predicted for invasive species?  If so, this may explain local adaptation to urban environments.  

</p>
<p>

   

</p>

","
<p>

  Behavioral data on desert populations will follow the same design and protocol as that being completed for urban widows. Juvenile females are collected from the field, brought into the lab, established in large, open-air containers and studied for the remainder of their lives. During this time, we collect data on behaviors (aggression towards prey, boldness towards predators, agonism towards conspecific competitors, aggression towards mates. 

</p>
<p>

  Genetic analyses will be performed on all females included in the behavioral analyses. At the conclusion of the 
<b>behavioral</b>
 analyses, females will be euthanized and preserved in a -80' ultralow freezer. Single legs will be removed for extraction of genomic nucleic acids using Qiagen (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) DNeasy Tissue Kits and these genomic extracts will be stored at -80Â°C. The AFLP analysis will be performed using Invitrogen s AFLP Core Reagent Kit (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). Restriction-ligation will be conducted using an 
Eco
RI/
Mse
I endonuclease mixture and double-stranded adaptors using primers containing no selective nucleotides. We will initially screen 48 +3 fluorescent, 5  dye-labeled primer pairs (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for selective amplification using nine individuals (3 from each habitat). These will be evaluated for informative polymorphisms and five to eight +3 primer pairs will be chosen for use in this study. The selectively amplified fragments will be separated on an ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer using the GeneScan 500-ROX size standard, and visualized using GeneMapper 4.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each DNA sample will be amplified at least twice to verify the reproducibility of the AFLP technique and only intense and unambiguous bands will be scored. 

</p>
<p>

  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  AFLPs generate high resolution-markers that estimate population genetic parameters through randomly sampling across the genome. They are relatively easy to develop and use, and because of their reliance on the polymerase chain reaction have high replicability. They have been successfully applied to numerous arthropod groups in studies looking at kin groups to studies examining interspecific systematics. The main drawback is that they are generally dominant markers, creating problems in estimating allele frequencies and genetic diversity. However, these problems are largely eliminated in highly polymorphic dominant marker data sets, and the screening of primer pairs described above will be based in part on this criterion. Genetic diversity will be estimated using the POPGEN program based on the percentage of polymorphic loci within-populations and Nei s expected gene diversity; population structure will be estimated by Nei s 
GST
<sub> </sub>
. These all assume that the population is at Hardy-Weinberg (HW) equilibrium, an assumption that may well be inappropriate given the dynamic nature of the urbanization of the Phoenix area. Therefore, we will also use the Bayesian approach of Holsinger 
et al.
 as implemented in the HICKORY version 1.0 program. This permits the estimation of population genetic parameters without assuming HW equilibrium. We will also examine the population structure among and within the habitats using an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA; using the program Arlequin.

"237","Urban Tree Health ","<p>

  Urban trees contribute significantly to human health and environmental quality by improving energy conservation, increasing carbon storage, removing air pollutants, moderating urban heat island effects, providing recreation and wildlife habitat and increasing aesthetics and property values.  The quality of life of nearly 80% of the US population is impacted by urban forests (Dwyer et al. 2003). Despite the economic, aesthetic and environmental benefits of urban forests, assessments of the health of this living resource are rare (Cumming et al. 2001).  Monitoring urban forest health is essential to identifying changes within the forest resource as well as providing a foundation for improving resource management practices (McPherson 1993). A protocol was developed to monitor urban tree health in the CAP LTER study area and was used to assess tree health at urban sites that have been monitored as part of the CAP LTER Primary Productivy montoring project and an additional Survey 200 sites.

"239","Ground Arthropod Diversity at North Desert Village","
<h1>
  Abstract
</h1>
<p>

  While many studies have shown that urbanization and land-use type significantly impacts species richness and evenness, few studies have investigated the mechanisms by which these changes occur. A residential neighborhood at ASU-Polytechnic Campus has been designed with 4 different neighborhood landscape regimes and provides the ideal opportunity to explore how local neighborhood landscaping affects biodiversity and food web structure and function of arthropod communities. The North Desert Village (NDV) databases on ground-dwelling arthropods will be used to compare species richness and abundance in before and after NDV treatments. Two years of post-treatment seasonal data on trophic structure will be compared to pre-treatment neighborhoods. This study will provide insights and understanding into the fundamental processes of how local landscaping practices alter diversity, relative abundances, and trophic structure of biological communities.

</p>

","
<p>

  
<b>Introduction</b>


</p>
<p>

  Urbanization is an intense human activity that can radically alter species richness, evenness and composition relative to wildlands (McKinney 2002). Whereas the patterns of changes in biodiversity in urbanized areas have been increasingly documented, the underlying processes and causes for these changes are virtually unknown (Faeth et al. 2005, Shochat et al. 2006).

</p>
<p>

  There have been few attempts to experimentally test the mechanisms that influence these changes in urban areas (Shochat et al. 2006). Recent studies in the CAP-LTER region using the native Sonoran desert plant, brittlebush (
Encelia farinosa
) have indicated that desert remnants behave more like urban mesic yards than the outlying desert (Faeth et. al. 2005). They also found that urban habitats exhibit a reduction in species diversity and altered species composition. McIntyre et. al. (2001) investigated the effects of urban land use on ground arthropod communities in the CAP-LTER region'based on long term pitfall traps 
in replicated
 land use types. These studies examined regional scale effects of residential, industrial, agricultural and desert remnant areas on arthropod communities. Whereas species richness did not differ, community composition varied among land use types. More specifically, they found that predators, herbivores and detritivores were most abundant in agricultural sites and omnivores were abundant in all sites, indicating that trophic dynamics vary by land use type
. 
Similiarly, Cook and Faeth (2006) investigated ground arthropod communities in agricultural fields, commercial sites, residential neighborhoods (xeric and mesic), desert remnants and natural desert areas. They found that the two most heavily irrigated and productive land use types (agricultural and mesic sites) supported the greatest abundance and number of arthropod taxa.Â  Notably desert remnants and outlying deserts differed in community composition. However Shochat et al. (2004) found that the more productive habitats (mesic sites and agricultural sites) had a lower number of taxa but greater spider abundance when compared to desert sites. Consequently, urbanization results in changing the food web structure and dynamics in urban areas.

</p>
<p>

  Understanding these changes is critical to management of habitats, species diversity, and invasive species in rapidly expanding urban areas. Investigations are currently underway at NDV that examine the effects of landscaping types on above-ground arthropod communities associated with individual 
Encelia farinosa
 plants. This study has no pre-treatment sampling and samples at the level of individual plants.Â  We propose a summer research grant to investigate how local neighborhood landscaping affects biodiversity and food web structure and function of arthropod communities. NDV presents the ideal opportunity to conduct such a study. The CAP-LTER has amassed a suite of data regarding ground arthropods at North Desert Village through sampling pitfall traps at NDV before and after the completion of the landscaping of the neighborhoods. We propose to compare ground arthropod data from before and after the establishment of the four landscape types. This invaluable arthropod database has yet to be analyzed and published.

</p>
<p>

  
<b>Methods</b>


</p>
<p>

  Five neighborhoods of different landscape regimes (native, xeric, mesic and oasis and control) have been established at North Desert Village, a residential community located at Arizona State University, Polytechnic Campus. Each neighborhood consists of 6 single-family homes arranged in a horseshoe shape surrounding a central common area that serves as community space. The native treatment consists of plants native to the Sonoran Desert, the xeric treatment has low water-use non-native plants, the mesic treatment has a lawn landscape supplemented with high water-use trees and the oasis is a combination of the xeric and oasis treatments. Finally, the control neighborhood has been left unmanipulated and the common area remains a section of unmaintained grass. We will utilize existing NDV databases on ground-dwelling arthropod richness and relative abundances for pre- and post-NDV treatments. The ''after'' database now includes 2 years of seasonal data from arthropods from 4 different treatments and the control neighborhood at NDV so we can also assess seasonal and yearly differences. Species diversity and abundance of the trophic guilds will then be compared across neighborhoods for pre- and post-treatments.

</p>
<p>

  
<b>Expected Results/Predictions</b>


</p>
<p>

  If arthropods respond to different landscape regimes, then we predict that landscape treatment will significantly alter the trophic structure and community composition of ground-dwelling arthropods at NDV. Specifically, we predict that the mesic habitats should have higher abundances but lower diversity than more xeric habitats or mesic &gt; oasis &gt; desert for abundances but the opposite for species richness. The two xeric treatments are native and non-native desert vegetation. We will also be able to test for differences in richness, abundances and trophic structure between these two desert landscapes. If these differ significantly, then this would suggest that not only is productivity essential in determining relative abundances, diversity and trophic structure, but also that reconstructed xeric habitats differ fundamentally by the identity of the vegetation. We expect that these results should be publishable in a top tier journal such as Ecological Applications.

</p>
<p>

  
<b>Significance</b>


</p>
<p>

  Ground-dwelling and plant associated arthropod communities are very different and thus this research, combined with current work ongoing at NDV, will provide a comprehensive picture of how neighborhood scale landscaping alters community and trophic structure. Because all species interact within food webs, understanding these changes is critical to management of habitats, species diversity, and invasive species in rapidly expanding urban areas. This project will provide insights and understanding into the fundamental processes of how urbanization and suburbanization alter diversity, relative abundances, and trophic structure of biological communities. In a practical sense, these analyses will tell us if biodiversity in non-native vegetated xeriscapes mimics that biodiversity found in xeriscapes with native vegetation.

<p>

  I request one-month of summer salary to work on three projects related to the Phoenix Area Social Survey 2006, which has recently completed data collection. The following is my research agenda for the summer of 2007.

</p>
<p>

   1. Supervision of students working on a study of crime, perceptions of crime, and vegetation in neighborhood parks.  GRA (Darren Ruddell, Ph.D. student) received summer funding from CAP LTER to work on this project under my supervision and we have also applied for an REU student to help with field work.  We will link the PASS responses with the location of parks, incidence of crimes, and measures of vegetation density and structure in GIS.  Using geographically weighted regressions we will assess community, park, and individual characteristics that influence whether residents regard parks as an ecological amenity or disamenity.

</p>
<p>

  2. I will also begin an analysis of the PASS data focused on developing measures of environmental poverty in neighborhoods. This paper (in collaboration with Paige Warren and others) will use survey data to model perceptions of neighborhood social and biophysical environments as well as other data to measure actual amenities/disamenities, such as vegetation abundance, shade, parks, open space, birds. The hypothesis is that neighborhood disparities in environmental quality explain place attachment, environmental concerns, and self-reported health (for examples of possible outcome variables).

</p>
<p>

  3. Under an NSF supplementary grant to CAP LTER, Kelli Larson, Amber Wutich, and I have created a subset of the PASS questionnaire on beliefs about the causes of environmental problems and attitudes toward environmental policies.  This is being designed as a web survey that will be administered to ASU environmental scientists (spring), state and local natural resource managers (summer), and public middle school and high school science teachers (fall).  The objective of this project is to compare the responses of ??experts? with the general public in order to understand similarities and differences in how they define key issues related to the protection of environmental resources.  We will continue our work on defining ??expert? samples and survey designs throughout the summer.

"242","Activity of Trace Elements in Desert-Urban Soil: Sequential Extraction, Mineralogy, and GIS Interpretation","
<p>

  Trace element distributions under the impact of anthropogenic activity have been extensively studied in recent years as the awareness of environmental pollution increases . Although reports about aerosol depositions and nutrient variations in urban desert environments are generated, these studies of trace elements rarely highlight the special features of such kind of environment. In a desert environment, as a result of little rain and high evaporation, material transport is likely to be slow. The sparse vegetation and dispersed biological activity will possibly keep material in the desert physically and compositionally stable. On the other hand, during rainy seasons, increased run-off and dust storms might result in tremendous material flux in the permeable and porous desert soil, and thus enhance material transport during each occurrence. The behavior of trace element in an urban-desert ecosystem is further complicated by the considerable amount of human input during urbanization. Elements such as Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn are usually reported to be associated with urban areas. Questions have been raised concerning the distribution, sources, sinks, transport, forms and toxicity of these trace elements in a desert undergoing rapid urbanization. Thus, studying the activity and bioavailability of trace elements in the desert-urban soil of MaricopaCounty in central Arizona is proposed to test the behavior of trace elements in such ecosystems and to assess and quantify the impacts of human activities.

 This exciting technique for examining the complex mixture of polar organic compounds in water provides both a broad picture or ??fingerprint  of the compounds present and specific-compound identification. Determining the reactivity of DOC in aqueous systems requires a detailed understanding of the specific compounds present in DOC. The potential to identify specific compounds and information about the reactivity of those compounds will provide a new understanding of DOC sources, potential ecosystem effects, and water quality implications. This study will provide a new understanding of DOC source and fate in the urban aquatic systems. In particular, this project will provide new separation techniques that can be used to explore transport and transformation of dissolved organic compounds in Phoenix area aquatic systems and will provide new information about how soil organic matter can be released by water. This molecular-level analysis of the range of compound types that can be extracted from soils and transported in rivers will provide new insights that begin to unlock the ??black box  of DOC composition. This work is relevant to CAP-LTER s  Integrated Project Areas

Fluxes of Materials and Socio-Ecosystem Response as well as the general research area of Biogeochemical Processes.

</p>

","
<p>

  Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a complex mixture of molecules from many different compound classes including: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and anthropogenic compounds (
1
). This wide array of compound types also has a range of terrestrial, aquatic and anthropogenic sources (
2-4
). Dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DON), can have a variety of ecosystem effects; they are regulated as a drinking water contaminants, they mediate the distribution of trace metals, they can provide a food and energy source for algae and bacteria, and, in the case of DON, may cause nutrient loading and eutrophication (
5-7
). A detailed understanding of the reactivity of terrestrial and anthropogenic DOC requires knowing the specific composition of the complex organic mixture. The distribution and reactivity of these compounds depends on their composition, and thus their source (i.e., photochemical reactions, vegetation and soils, microbial production, industrial processes, combustion, etc., 
8, 9, 10
). Until recently, the detailed chemical composition of DOC has not been well known as many of the compounds present in DOC are not readily detected using standard analytical techniques(
11, 12
). The organic compounds in DOC are by definition 
polar
 since they are soluble in water, but many molecular-level organic analyses are specific for non-polar organic compounds. New analytical techniques are required to assess the composition of DOC. Our laboratory is developing state-of-the-art mass spectrometry techniques for examining polar organic compounds in water using liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. This proposal requests funds for H. Hartnett to develop liquid chromatography separation techniques to advance this molecular-level characterization work.

</p>
<p>

  
Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry


</p>
<p>

  Liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS) is a novel application for environmental samples that allows the molecular-level analysis of polar organic compounds in water (Fig. 1). This technique requires only small aqueous samples (&lt;1ml), detects a very large array of compound classes, and requires little or no sample extraction or pre-concentration. This technique provides information about the molecular weight distribution of the compounds present; chemical characterization through liquid chromatography, as well as through positive and negative ion detection; and specific compound identification when coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (
13
). This technique has recently been demonstrated in rain water (
8, 14
) and stream water (
9
), ground water (
15
), and for riverine humic and fulvic acids (
16, 17
).

</p>
<p>

  LC-ESI MS has distinct advantages over other techniques used to characterize DOC. Because this technique provides both molecular weight distributions and compound identification, it gives additional information relative to techniques that provide only functional group information (NMR, IR) or simply molecular weight distributions based on size (ultrafiltration, size-exclusion chromatography). Given that most of compounds present in DOC are polar, the LC-ESI MS technique has significant advantages over GC-MS because gas chromatography looks specifically at non-polar compounds which are present at relatively low abundance in aquatic systems. Hartnett s environmental biogeochemistry laboratory is equipped with a TSQ Quantum LC-ESI system (Finnigan) with a triple-quadrupole detector for tandem mass spectrometry analyses and a bulk DOC /N high-temperature combustion system (Shimadzu).

</p>
<p>

  To date, the majority of the work in our lab has focused on direct injection of samples into the mass spectrometer. In order to better examine the range of compound classes present in DOC, separation by liquid chromatography is required. Polar organic compounds are likely to be the most reactive in aquatic systems and are likely to be the compounds most readily extracted from soils using water as a solvent. Chromatographic separation using C18 and C4 columns designed for aqueous mobile phases will be explored. The C18 columns are specific to the more non-polar compounds present in water, the C4 columns have shorter carbon chains and thus allow separation of more polar compounds.

</p>
<p>

  We propose to study the amount and composition of DOC in archived samples from Tempe Town Lake, from the Verde River. We will also analyze soil samples that have been extracted using distilled water. Differences and similarities in the sources of DOC to the river, lake and soils can be inferred from the differences in the molecular-level composition. The DOC and the biogeochemical and physical processes that transform that DOC (microbial attack, adsorption to mineral surfaces, etc) can be monitored by bulk carbon analyses but ultimately, this only reveals how much carbon was lost or gained. To understand which components of the DOC are reactive in the environment (RA: Biogeochemical Processes) and which have the potential to impact ecosystems (IPA:
<b> </b>
Fluxes of Materials and Socio-Ecosystem Response) requires a molecular-level knowledge of the compounds that are dissolved in or readily desorbed into aquatic systems (
18-22
).

"249","Characterization of Microclimates Created by Landscape Design Styles in North Desert Village","
<p>

  
<b>Abstract</b>


</p>
<p>

  Understanding the effect of landscape design styles on the immediate surroundings and on the plants within them is an important element of understanding our interactions with the urban environment. Little previous research has been done to quantify the interactions between landscape design style, the immediate microclimate and the plants within it.  The aim of this project is to collect data necessary for determining any distinctive microclimate characteristics created by different landscape design styles. Data will be collected in the CAP LTER research site at North Desert Village on the ASU Polytechnic campus. Data to be collected includes air temperature, relative humidity, soil temperature, sub-surface temperature, soil heat flux, and soil moisture content. Microclimate data will be used in subsequent research to determine the adaptive and immediate physiological responses of trees to growing in different microclimates.

</p>
<p>

  

</p>

","
<p>

  
<b>Introduction</b>


</p>
<p>

  Trees are a crucial part of the urban landscape, but all too often they are planted in residential landscape settings with little thought for optimizing tree growth and health or considering interactions within the landscape. Most municipalities within the CAP LTER have or are developing recommendations and guidelines for planting trees; however, many of these recommendations are not founded on substantial research.

</p>
<p>

  Urban tree growth has been studied in a variety of circumstances in many parts of the country (Kjelgren and Clark, 1994) (Whitlow and Bassuk, 1988). For example, Montague et al (2000) indicate surface energy balances created by vegetative and non-vegetative ground cover significantly affects the gas exchange and growth of two deciduous species in northern Utah. Non-vegetative ground covers have wide use in the Phoenix area. Previous CAP LTER studies have shown that soil temperatures are affected by mulch selection (Singer and Martin, 2005). However, little research has been done in the Phoenix area to unify the elements of microclimate research, such as soil temperature, in connection to human interactions within the landscape and the growth of trees in the landscape. The CAP LTER research site at North Desert Village on the ASU Polytechnic campus provides the opportunity to examine the influence of local landscape design styles on the growth and health of native and drought-tolerant tree species commonly utilized in the Phoenix area.

</p>
<p>

  Residential landscape designs in the greater Phoenix area can be generally classified into three major types based on the plant palette and irrigation style (Martin et al, 2003). A mesic design is characterized by extensive turf and large shade trees with a sprinkler irrigation system. Xeric designs use native and introduced low-water-use plants, which are individually irrigated with a drip system with the remaining area covered in decomposing granite. The oasis design is a combination of mesic and xeric. Typical oasis designs incorporate elements of xeric on the outside edge of a landscape, surrounding a mesic area in the middle. An additional, though less common design style is native, which is characterized by native plants that are not irrigated after establishment.'
</p>

  As urbanization expands, natural desert ecosystems are replaced with man-made landscapes. Understanding the effect of the various design styles on the immediate surroundings and on the plants within them is an important element of understanding our interactions with the urban environment (Spronken-Smith 2000). This project seeks to compare the microclimates created by the four landscape design styles described here as part of a more extensive study of microclimate and plant interactions.

</p>
<p>

  
<b>Research Objective</b>


</p>
<p>

  The overall goal of this line of research is to quantify the adaptive and immediate physiological responses of urban trees to being grown in different microclimates. This proposal describes a project that is one step in this line of research, namely defining and determining the characteristics of microclimates created by four landscape design styles used in the greater Phoenix area, preparatory to quantifying the growth rate and physiological responses of urban trees to placement in each of the design styles. The specific aim is to measure air temperature, relative humidity, soil temperature, sub-surface temperature, soil heat flux, and soil moisture content in four landscape designs styles in the North Desert Village research site on the ASU Polytechnic campus. The work covered in this grant will address the following questions: What effects do design style have on the microclimate of a landscape? What are the microclimate characteristics in different landscape design styles? Do they differ?Â 

</p>
<p>

  
<b>Project Description</b>
Â 

</p>
<p>

  In order to determine the magnitude and range of the effect of different design styles on the immediate surroundings, a field experiment has been designed to define the extent to which planting design style influences the microclimate within a residential planting site. This experiment will utilize the CAP LTER research site at North Desert Village (NDV) on the ASU Polytechnic campus. Four neighborhood common areas have been planted with the most common landscape design styles used in the desert southwest: mesic, oasis, xeric and native. Air and soil conditions will be monitored in and around each site to better understand the interaction of plants with their surroundings. Existing meteorology stations on site will record air temperature, soil temperature, sub-surface temperature, soil heat flux, and soil moisture content. Recordings will be taken every five minutes and averaged over an hour. HOBO data loggers will be installed at the surface to record variation in surface temperatures across the sites. Additional air temperature readings will be taken via mobile transects. These transects will measure any variation in air temperature across the sites and above and below canopy height. Data collected from HOBO data loggers and mobile transects will be used to determine the validity of generalized application of meteorology station data. Optimal frequency of mobile transect recordings has yet to be determined. During the subsequent academic year, these data will be analyzed in order to determine the differences between the microclimates in the NDV research sites.

</p>
<p>

  As part of the more extensive goals of this research, measurements of trees previously planted by CAP LTER will be taken during the second week of June. Measurements include tree height, trunk diameter, canopy spread and extension growth of four selected branches. These measurements will be compared with others to be taken throughout the year to determine overall tree growth in all four landscape sites.

</p>
<p>

  
<b>Expected Results</b>


</p>
<p>

  It is expected that analysis of data will indicate significant differences in the microclimates of each landscape design style within NDV. The greatest differences are expected between the mesic and native designs and the least difference between xeric and native designs.Â  It is also expected that the soil and sub-surface temperatures will vary more between sites than air temperature. While these results may seem intuitive, this project seeks to quantify the differences as preparatory data for subsequent tree growth research.

</p>
<p>

  
<b>Significance</b>
Â 

</p>
<p>

  This project contributes to the overall goals of the CAP LTER project by further studying the interactions between humans, plants and urban microclimates. Ultimately, this research has the potential to provide support for evidence-based recommendations for urban landscape planting.Â

"250","Belowground Nutrient Pools and Dynamics in Xeriscaped Yards","
<p>

  The proposed research addresses the question, ??How does urbanization affect the availability and distribution of nutrient pools and dynamics??  I hypothesize that availability and distribution of soil nutrients is affected through two main components of urbanization: indirect human influence through exposure to the altered urban climate; and direct human influence through land management practices.  During the summer of 2006, I collected soil samples in three landscape types with varying degrees of human influence: outlying desert, urban desert, and xeriscaped residential yards.  While xeriscaped yards and urban desert support similar pools of organic matter and inorganic N, xeriscapes have elevated soil moisture and lower net potential N cycling than urban desert. Addition of leaf tissue chemistry data would help elucidate the N cycle in xeriscapes and connect above- and belowground nutrient dynamics.  For all soil pools and processes measured, urban sites were more variable than outlying desert.  While the study conducted in 2006 provided a good ??snapshot  of nutrient pools and dynamics in xeriscapes, a larger sample size would greatly improve the value and statistical power of these findings.  In the summer of 2007, I propose to double the sample size for each landscape type and measure soil organic matter, total carbon and nitrogen, and leaf tissue chemistry.

Introduction


</p>
<p>

  Arid ecosystems cover approximately one third of the earth s surface, and are being altered by urban development at an unprecedented rate (FAO 1989).'Urbanization influences the main drivers of biogeochemical cycles by manipulating hydrology, atmospheric chemistry, nutrient cycles, land use, and land cover (Kaye et al 2006).Â  In the Sonoran desert, biogeochemical cycles are constrained by both water and nutrient availability.Â  Urban development in the Phoenix metropolitan area has redistributed these limiting factors, evening availability through both space and time.Â  This raises particular interest in elucidating biogeochemical cycles within the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research (CAP LTER) site.Â  

</p>
<p>

  Several studies in the CAP LTER site have demonstrated effects of urbanization on belowground ecosystem processes within the Phoenix metropolitan area.Â  Results from the 200-point survey demonstrate that exposure to Phoenix s urban climate elevates inorganic soil N and net potential N processing rates (Zhu et al 2006, Hope et al 2005).Â  Furthermore, Lewis et al (2006) showed that prior agricultural use increases pools of soil organic matter, total carbon, and total nitrogen for at least 20 years after agricultural activity ends.Â  Not only does urbanization affect the sizes of soil nutrient pools, it also alters their spatial distribution.Â  The characteristic resource island pattern in undisturbed desert is absent in agricultural fields and mesic parks (Jenerette et al 2006).Â  Because of their stark difference from the surrounding desert, agriculture and mesic landscapes have received particular attention from CAP LTER researchers.Â  However, xeric, or low water-use landscaping is a popular, yet seldom-studied land cover type within the CAP ecosystem.Â  

</p>
<p>

  In the Phoenix metropolitan area, xeric or mixed landscapes containing xeric vegetation represent 54% of residential yards and 20% of the urban land area (Corinna Gries, personal communication).Â  These xeriscaped yards often include native plant species that have replaced non-native species.Â  Traditionally, ecological restoration projects focused on replacing non-native plants with native species, and assumed restored ecosystem function would follow. However, increasing evidence indicates that function does not always follow form, particularly in highly altered environments like urban areas.Â  

</p>
<p>

  
To compare the belowground function of xeriscaped yards with undisturbed desert, I employed a spatially explicit sampling design beneath and away from two native Sonoran desert plants that are also common in xeric landscaping: brittlebush (
Encelia farinosa
) and Palo verde trees (
Parkinsonia spp.
).Â  I hypothesized that availability and distribution of soil nutrients would be affected through two main components of urbanization: indirect human influence through exposure to the altered urban climate; and direct human influence through land management. To distinguish urban climate effects from direct human management, I sampled sites in undisturbed desert preserves within the urban airshed, or â??urban desert  sites, and compared these to undisturbed desert away from the urban climate, or â??outlying desert,  and xeriscaped yards that were preceded by grass lawn and agriculture. Â I predicted that indirect human influence in urban desert would enrich soil resources compared to outlying desert, and direct human management would further increase soil resource availability (Figure 1).Â  In addition, the magnitude of resource islands beneath plants would be decreased in urban desert by elevation of soil resources between plants.Â  Previous agricultural and lawn maintenance in xeriscaped yards would result in the most even distribution of soil resources of the three landscape types (Figure 2).

</p>
<p>

  I was fortunate to receive a summer research grant from the CAP LTER project in 2006. Â Results showed that soil resources varied according to landscape type, plant species, and proximity to plant canopy.Â  Inorganic soil N and SOM pools beneath Palo verde trees were statistically similar among sites, regardless of position within the urban landscape. Â In contrast, resource pools beneath brittlebushes were elevated inside the city.Â  Exposure to the urban climate doubled inorganic soil N near brittlebushes from 9.5 Âµg 

</p>
<p>

  N/gram dry soil in outlying desert to 35.1 Âµg N/gram dry soil in urban desert. Â This trend is consistent with Survey 200 results (Jenerette et al 2006, Zhu et al 2006).Â  SOM and net potential N cycling were also elevated in urban compared to outlying desert sites.

</p>
<p>

  Human management in xeriscaped yards did not alter pools of SOM or inorganic N beyond the effects of the urban atmosphere.Â  Yet despite this, mean rates of net potential N cycling in xeriscaped yards were half of that in urban deserts.Â  Furthermore, xeriscaped yards contained significantly higher soil moisture (mean of 1.88%) than either urban desert or outlying desert (means of 1.08% and 0.98%, respectively) (Figure 3).Â  While 2 of 5 xeriscaped yards received drip irrigation, the soil moisture content in these yards was not significantly different from yards that did not receive any supplemental irrigation.Â  In addition, soil moisture was elevated between plants as well as beneath plants where drip irrigation occurs, indicating that either soil properties or local microclimate conditions contribute to this difference.Â  The decreased net potential N cycling rates may reflect an increase in N uptake by microbes and plants that is enabled by improved water availability.Â  However, further work is needed to explain this finding.Â  

</p>
<p>

  These results reflect work performed at 5 sites in each land use category.Â  While some conclusions can be drawn, the highly variable nature of the urban system resulted in non-significant results for some variables.Â  For example, patterns of soil organic matter cannot be resolved with the current sample size and data set (Figure 4).Â  It is unclear whether these landscape types are truly similar, or if the high variability between urban sites masks differences between sites.Â  

</p>
<p>

  I presented these results at two meetings: the LTER All-Scientist Meeting in Estes Park, Colorado, in September, 2006; and the 9
<sup>th</sup>
 annual CAP LTER Poster Symposium in January, 2007.

</p>

</p>

Proposed Work for Summer 2007


</p>
<p>

  During the summer of 2007, I propose to increase sample size to 10 Â sites in each landscape type in order to increase statistical power for soil organic matter, total carbon and total nitrogen. These soil resource pools change slowly so that comparison between 2006 and 2007 would be possible.Â  In addition, I will collect leaves from brittlebush and Palo verde trees to compare tissue chemistry.Â  This aboveground nutrient pool would provide an interesting link between above- and belowground ecosystem processes.Â  Leaf tissue chemistry may also help determine whether plants in xeriscaped yards use more N than deserts plants.Â  Research conducted by an undergraduate researcher in Nancy Grimm s lab indicated a trend toward low C:N ratios within the city, but lack statistical power to draw a conclusion (Bony Ahmed, unpublished data).Â  Higher plant N demand could explain reduced net potential N cycling in xeriscaped yards compared to urban deserts.

  This work will be conducted under the supervision and guidance of Dr. Sharon Hall.Â  All data and results collected for this research project will be shared with the CAP-LTER Information Manager.

"255","Walkability, park access and environmental justice in two Phoenix neighborhoods","
<p>

  A growing literature on obesigenic environments - those whose infrastructure encourages obesity-causing behaviors - demonstrates a connection between the built environment and walking behavior. Walkability studies examine the suitability of neighborhood form and function for walking as both a means of recreation and transportation. These walkability characteristics of a neighborhood have been found to correlate well with physical activity and BMI.  Since physical activity is a significant preventative measure for obesity, and because streets are the most frequently used physical activity space, walkability studies have become increasingly common in the public health literature.  The impact of environmental factors on residents activity level and obesity rates raises the question of how these built environmental characteristics are distributed in space. Like other environmental justice concerns, characteristics of an andldquounwalkableandrdquo neighborhood may disproportionately exist in communities with more low-income or minority residents, which tend to have higher rates of obesity than affluent and white communities do.

</p>
<p>

  This study examines the walkability of neighborhoods in Phoenix using a variety of GIS metrics combined with walkability audits of two PASS neighborhoods, U18 in South Phoenix and U21 in Ahwatukee. A walkability audit tool was developed for a handheld PDA. It is used to record information on street, sidewalk, recreation, and land use characteristics of street segments. The analysis is nearly complete and a manuscript will be sent out for a review by the end of August.

"256","Urban bird dynamics: the credit card theory","<section>
  Bird population densities in urban settings are higher than in wildlands. This established global patterns


  has been suggested to be the result of increased food abundance (bottom-up effect), decrease in predation pressure (top-down effect), or both.


  
  


  Field experiments with seed trays from CAP-LTER suggest that urban birds are ''desperate for food''. They are more efficient than desert birds in acquiring food and depleting food resources. While ecological theory predicts a linear relationship between resource and forager abundance, our results suggest that there are less food items per capita in urban settings. In other words - population size exceeds the expected. We call this situation ''resource over-matching''. If urban population size is too high, is should crash to the ''carrying capacity'' (K) of the urban habitat. The ''credit card theory'' explains why it does not.


  
  


  To date, ecologists only considered ''food abundance'' when discussing bottom-up effects. The credit card theory considers another important aspect of the bottom-up effect on urban populations: predictability. While resource input in wildlands is unpredictable (e.g, depends on rains, winds etc.), it is highly predictable in the city, owing to the human daily/weekly routine. Predictable environments may change decision making rules on the short term and population dynamics on the long term.


  
  


  The credit card theory hypothesizes that with their ''permanent income'', urban birds, just like humans, ""live on their credit"". Knowing when and where to find food each day, they can afford to increase their clutch size and fledge more young. The fledglings will suffer high competition, but have a fair chance to survive on the long term. To summarize: continuous input of resources changes the rules of the ''evolutionary game'' in the urban environment.


  
  

</section>
","<section>
  Theory rationale and scenario:


  
  


  - Urban bird density overmatches resource abundance


  - Population size does not crash to the K (carrying capacity) in terms of bird density.


  - Such a situation must have a cost, and the cost is in body condition. Urban birds should be leaner on average than wildland birds.


  - Natural selection removes lean individuals from the population in widlands, but not in cities. The unhealthy lean individuals persist because they manage to find enough food each day to keep them going.


  - Lean individuals cannot reproduce. Thus, the urban population must have a few winners and many losers. Only the winners reproduce. The losers ''float''.


  - In the wildland losers do not survive. They starve or being removed by predators. Wildland populations consist of many winners and fewer losers.


  
  


  While this idea follows some rationale, it is not clear whether it can work in reality. To address that, we developed a mathematical model that tested whether ''urban'' conditions can cause the flip between losers and winners, so that the losers outnumber the winners under urban conditions. The model shows that urban conditions indeed flip the loser/winner ratio, but that both the bottom-up effect (high food predictability) and top-down affect (reduced predation pressure)'can lead to this pattern. It is likely that both factors control urban bird population regulation.


  
  


  The importance of this research goes beyond the theoretical framework. Mechanistic approach is rare in urban community ecology. Our model suggest a mechanism for a global pattern - the inflated population density, as well as for the differences in foraging behavior between urban and wildland birds, observed in CAP. Further, that so many losers can float on the long term and remain in the system may have significant influence on community structure and may explain another well established pattern in urban settings - the loss of diversity.

"258","Human and biophysical drivers of residential landscape management and ecological outcomes","
<p>Intensively managed household yards are an important, yet understudied, feature of urban ecosystems. Grass now covers an area that amounts to the largest irrigated crop in the United States, covering 25-40 million acres and contributing to high rates of water and fertilizer use. But little is known about how homeowner decisions about residential landscape management impact ecological processes in soils and vegetation or what drives these landscape management decisions.  CAP LTER scientists Kelli Larson and Sharon Hall along with a team of graduate and undergraduate researchers have begun investigating residential landscapes in neighborhoods across Phoenix, Arizona. Their research uses social surveys of homeowners coupled with field surveys of yards to answer two primary questions: What are the factors that drive residential landscape management decisions? How do landscape management practices affect vegetation structure, microclimate, and other ecological processes?


</p>","<p>We combined a social survey with observational field methods to assess residents’ values and land-management practices in four diverse neighborhoods of Phoenix, Arizona. A mail questionnaire was designed to address the three value domains—general life values, broad environmental orientations, and specific yard priorities—while also measuring self-reported behaviors, including grass cover in yards, irrigation frequency and methods, and chemical inputs. The field survey examined yard characteristics, including ground cover, home characteristics, and vegetation species composition from the sidewalk in front of sampled houses.

systems dynamics model known as WaterSim. WaterSim produces profiles of water shortage conditions under different climate change scenarios, drought conditions, population growth rates, and policy decisions. WaterSim is used as a tool to inform water-related decision-making in metropolitan Phoenix.  The WaterSim model was created by the DecisionCenter for a Desert City (DCDC) and is shown to Arizona decision-makers in small groups in the Decision Theater of Arizona State University.

  Because it unites Arizona environmental decision-makers in an informal setting and prompts group discussions, WaterSim presentations provide a valuable opportunity to study the socio-political dynamics that shape environmental decision-making and outcomes in Arizona. Specifically, the study explores the following questions: (1) what kinds of knowledge, values, and political constraints underlie environmental decision-making in Arizona?; (2) how do Arizona decision-makers perceive and respond to environmental uncertainties?; (3) how can scientific data best be used to inform environmental decision-making?

  In fall of 2007, DCDC and CAP-LTER scholars jointly initiated a longitudinal social scientific study designed around the Decision Theater sessions in which WaterSim is presented to decision-makers. The sessions are held with three kinds of decision-making groups: policymakers, data analysts, and consultants.'The data collection consists of a series of individual and focus groups interviews, conducted around annually updated versions of the WaterSim model in 2007, 2008, and 2009.

"261","Developing carbon budgets for cities:  Phoenix metropolitan region as a case study","
<p>

  Studies have shown that cities can alter regional carbon dynamics through changing ecosystem productivity, overall carbon cycling rate, and total carbon storage in vegetation and soils.  Furthermore, people in urban regions import a large amount of carbon in food and fuel, as well as release an exceptional amount of CO2 into the atmosphere. Numerous studies have attempted to quantify some sources and sinks of carbon in urban areas, although a complete carbon budget for a city that accounts for total inputs, outputs, and storage within the ecosystem has yet to be fully accomplished.  One challenge is associated with attaining the data necessary to accurately account for all carbon dynamics in these heterogeneous and complex systems.  Our goal was to estimate a budget for the Phoenix metropolitan area while developing methodology to calculate carbon dynamics in urban systems that can be applied to cities across the US. Only with comparable carbon budgets for multiple cities will we finally begin to understand the influence of urbanization on carbon dynamics.  Many calculations can be determined from both bottom-up and top-down methodologies, and although these approaches should provide similar results, the data source can restrict how the results are interpreted and the spatial scale at which they are relevant.  Like other studies have suggested transportation is associated with the highest output of carbon from the Phoenix system, and city wide vegetation can do little to offset emissions; however, it is important to recognize there are many other sources and sinks where small changes can accumulate to be a large contribution to reducing our citywide CO2 footprint.

"262","Characterization of Dissolved Organic Carbon in Tempe Town Lake by Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS)","<p>

  Tempe Town Lake is a man-made urban aquatic system in downtown Tempe, AZ isolated within a short segment of the Salt River channel.  Most of the year, the lake is enclosed by two inflatable dams and the Salt river proper has a very low flow rate. In January of 2005, high winter rainfall led to significant water flows in the Salt and Verde Rivers and for the first time since the lake was built, the dams were lowered and the river allowed to flow in a relatively normal fashion. We took advantage of this natural experiment to monitor basic water quality parameters (Temperature, pH, Conductivity, dissolved Oxygen) and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon in the Salt River as it flowed through Tempe, and to examine how these properties evolved in Tempe Town Lake after the dams were raised. Samples of the river/lake have been collected daily from Jan.- Nov. 2005 and approximately monthly thereafter. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the lake were relatively high (5-7 mg C/L) in the winter while the river was flowing. After the dams were raised in early March, DOC concentrations decreased monotonically to ~3.5 mg C/L over the course of the spring and early summer; conductivity increased dramatically as a result of evaporation during this same period. With the onset of the summer monsoon rains, DOC concentrations in the lake increased again and became more variable (3-6 mg C/L). These results suggest that during rainy seasons organic carbon from the land is washed into the river/lake. During dry periods however, biogeochemical process that may include photo-chemical oxidation, microbial degradation, flocculation and settling decrease the concentration of dissolved organic carbon in the lake.

</p>
<p>

  Understanding the source and reactivity of DOC requires knowing not only how much carbon is present but also what kinds of organic compounds are present.  We hypothesize that the DOC composition will be different throughout the year because sources vary seasonally (terrestrial vs. riverine carbon) and a range of processes (photosynthesis, respiration, photooxidation) can control DOC cycling in the lake.  Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is a analytical tool that provides molecular-level analysis of the compounds present in DOC. We are analyzing selected samples representative of each season of each year and preliminary ESI-MS work shows that the majority of compounds present in the system during the early summer are have a molecular weight range of 30-200 atomic mass units (amu) and basic functional groups. A much smaller percentage of the compounds have acidic functionality. This work represents one of the first studies of the complex mixture of dissolved organic compounds present in an urban aquatic system, and will provide insights as to the source and reactivity of that dissolved organic carbon.

  This year a student and I would choose several morphological zones of the metropolitan region (desert fringe, agricultural fringe, infill, and core regions) to investigate typical densities observed and using a diurnal energy model accounting for radiation and thermal storage of buildings test with surface temperature sensors through field sampling with available equipment whether a model know as SHIM (Surface Heat Island Model, Voogt et al) is capable of predicting conditions across these variable zones. The model would be parameterized to work with the results of the field work. We would also like to study a short sampling period at NDV doing mobile sampling among a sample of homes over three of the treatments -- we envision working with Chris Martin for some selected days.

  The work would involve a one on one discussion of the model with the student, learning how to sample surface temperatures and sampling in the field, and how to write an article from the research.

"266","LTREB: Long-term climate variability and ecosystem response in a desert stream","
<p>
The primary objective of this project is to understand how long-term climate variability influences the structure and function of desert streams. Climate and hydrology are intimately linked in arid landscapes; for this reason, desert streams are particularly well suited for both observing and understanding the consequences of climate variability and directional change. Arid regions are characterized by high interannual variation in precipitation, and these climate patterns drive the overall disturbance regime (in terms of flooding and drying) and nutrient status of desert stream ecosystems. At long time scales, the number and size of floods in a given year or cluster of years dictate nutrient delivery to streams from the surrounding catchment, and also influence the biogeomorphic structure of the stream-riparian corridor. Embedded within this decadal-scale hydrologic regime , flash floods scour stream channels and initiate a series of rapid successional changes by benthic algae and macroinvertebrates at short time scales (i.e., within a year). An important goal of this research is to determine how recovery following discrete events is influenced by both stream nutrient status and channel structure and to thus better understand how long-term climate variability and change guide the interactions among slow (biogeomorphic change) and fast (post-flood succession) features and processes characteristic of desert stream ecosystems.

"286","Urbanization effects on primary productivity in a desert city: reduced wind and increased shade as major factors ","<p>

  Preliminary results from an ongoing field experiment reveal that brittlebushes grow significantly better in urban areas than in open desert and remnant sites, despite that plants are subject to same water conditions. Previous research from the Central Arizona Phoenix Long Term Ecological Research supports that urban plants have higher gas exchange rates because of increased water availability. One of the most significant differences in weather in cities is wind speed, an often overlooked consequence of urbanization and its effect on biological productivity. Both average daily wind speed and maximum wind speeds are almost twice as high in desert areas surrounding the city, as in urban areas, such as parks and yards. Reduction in wind speed is presumably due to built structures and increased density of trees. Wind tunnel and lab experiments have demonstrated elevated transpiration rates with increasing wind, in addition to a decline in CO
<sub>2</sub>
 assimilation due to reduced leaf boundary layer thickness. We propose that wind is a major stress factor on plants growing in desert habitats and semi-arid habitats. Wind, which is reduced in the city, is predicted to cause plants to grow better. To our knowledge, this has never been tested in the field in the context of urbanization. We propose to test wind effects on plant productivity in established research sites in desert, urban, and desert remnant sites. This project spans over two integrated project areas, Human Control of Biodiversity and Climate ?? Ecosystem Interactions.

</p>

","<p>

  
<b>Overview</b>


</p>
<p>

  Baker et al. (2002) demonstrated that urbanization in Phoenix leads to a heat island effect, meaning increased temperatures in the city compared to surrounding natural areas. An important effect on desert plants grown in the city is the alleviation of cold stress in the winter, while increased maximum temperatures would only be unfavorable. Other potential effects are increased ozone (Ellis et al. 2000, Atkinson-Palombo et al. 2006) and CO
<sub>2</sub>
 levels and airborne nutrient deposition (Fenn et al. 2003a, Fenn et al. 2003b), which would respectively have negative and to some degree positive effects on plant growth. Martin and Stabler (2002) found that vegetation in irrigated, managed residential landscapes had higher gas exchange fluxes leading to higher carbon acquisition potential than those in nearby non-irrigated, undisturbed desert areas, because of different water availability and plant water status. In a current field experiment testing the effects of urbanization on trophic dynamics, we found that brittlebushes (
Encelia farinosa
 Gray) grown under similar water conditions grow significantly better in urban areas than in both outlying desert sites and desert remnant sites within the city (Fig. 1).

  What causes this difference? Since all our field locations have the same experimental design, we propose an effect of habitat type, specifically wind speed. All our urban sites are characterized by having trees, buildings and walls in close proximity to the plants, while our desert and remnant sites are in open areas, having scattered trees and vegetation, and no buildings or walls. We hypothesize that these structures are major factors contributing to different wind patterns between the city and open desert areas (Fig.2). Urban areas surrounded by buildings and vegetation have a significantly lower maximum and average wind speed, than do desert areas lacking these structures. This can be a significant factor in the increased brittlebush growth rate we observed in the city. Supporting the findings of Martin and Stabler (2002), we hypothesize that the reduced wind velocity in the city facilitates leaf gas exchange, increasing overall plant productivity via a continuously more stable boundary layer.

</p>
<p>

  It is well documented that wind can have a range of effects on plant growth (e.g., Brown 1910, Finnell 1928, Martin and Clements 1935, Rao 1938, Whitehead 1962, 1965, Sturrock 1970, Russell and Grace 1978, McAneney et al. 1984, Cleugh et al. 1998, Hodges and Brandle 2006, Cordero et al. 2007). Martin and Clements (1935) found a reduction in leaf area, stem height, diameter, dry mass and total transpiration with increasing wind velocity. Other studies have found that plants exposed to high wind speeds were shorter, lighter in weight, thinner stalked, had narrower leaves, smaller leaf area, fewer tillers or reduced rate of leaf extension (Rao 1938, Whitehead 1962, Russell and Grace 1978). Russell and Grace (1978) however, also found an increase in net assimilation rate. 

</p>
<p>

  Â 

</p>
<p>

  The reason for this reduction in growth can be described as follows: During photosynthesis, the greatest CO
<sub>2</sub>
 partial pressure is found in a thin boundary layer of air near the leaf surface. The thickness of this boundary layer and subsequent variation in CO
<sub>2</sub>
 partial pressure differences are responsive to leaf position, pubescence, shape, thickness and above all on the degree of air movement (Larcher 1975). In still air, the layer can be some millimeters thick, while a strong wind will sweep it entirely away. The boundary layer is humid, and helps prevent transpiration. By reducing humidity around the leaf surface, wind increases transpiration and alters the rate of heat exchange between the leaf and the ambient environment (Larcher 1975). These physiological properties are directly connected to an increased water use and a reduced uptake of CO
<sub>2 </sub>
(Martin and Clements 1935), which in environments with a lack of water should lead to reduced productivity.

</p>
<p>

  Â 

</p>
<p>

  In addition to the removal of the boundary layer, the direct mechanical damage may be considerable (McAneney et al. 1984, Cleugh et al. 1998): Although unlikely a major cause of growth differences between sheltered and unsheltered crops grown outdoors, wind-induced plant movement is capable of altering growth rates and leaf morphology. The wind''s force can tear leaves or strip them from the plant. Dense plant canopies may suffer abrasion through intermittent or constant rubbing. Soil particles lifted into suspension by the wind have the potential to abrade and damage plant tissue (Jaffe 1980, Cleugh et al. 1998, Hodges and Brandle 2006). In the case of the SonoranDesert, this would literally translate to sandblasting. Continuing along these lines of thought, the hairs on the leaves of 
E. farinosa
 may be removed by strong winds carrying sand particles, thereby further reducing the boundary layer. Research has shown that pubescence on leaves of 
E. farinosa
 reduces the photosynthetic rate (Ehleringer et al. 1976, Ehleringer 1982), and protects the plant from extreme air temperatures (Ehleringer and Bjorkman 1978).

</p>
<p>

  Â 

</p>
<p>

  Mechanical stimulation has been tested in many vascular plants, producing reduced stem elongation and an increase in stem diameter. This response, called thigmomorphogenesis by Jaffe (1980), involves the motion induced reallocation of growth. From an ecological point of view, thigmomorphogenesis may have adaptive significance, and may also represent a developmental response to mechanical stress suffered by plants in windy areas (Cordero et al. 2007). In urban areas we would expect to find (and have seen) the opposite trait responses such as thinner stems, but taller plants (pers. obs.) due to reduced wind exposure.

</p>
<p>

  Â 

</p>
<p>

  Although wind experiments have been performed since the beginning of the last century using fans, wind tunnels, natural and artificial shelter, no one to our knowledge has done a field experiment in the context of urbanization.

<b>Project description</b>


</p>
<p>

  We propose to use already established research plots, but extend each area to include 20 more brittlebushes, on which we will perform the wind treatments. One group of ten plants will be protected by a windbreak shield (see Fig.3), while the other ten plants will have similar position, but without the windbreak. Wind direction is determined by the location of each site, since the winds in the Phoenix area tend to be diurnal â?? upslope in daytime, and downslope at night (Nancy Selover, pers. comm.). Wind direction will be determined prior to position of the windbreak to ensure optimal functioning of the windbreak (Wilson and Flesch 2003, Hodges and Brandle 2006). As for windbreak materials, we are still investigating the best way to hinder wind movement without causing turbulence as we would if we were using solid barriers of plywood or similar (Moen 1974). We will select a design so as to limit the impact of shade and to allow us to directly measure the effect of wind, not confounded by the effects of shade. Shading of plants can reduce the proportion of soluble carbohydrates and increase the proportion of cellulose and lignin (Hight et al. 1968), but have also been found to increase growth of 
E. farinosa
 (Smith and Nobel 1978). Shade however, is also an effect of the landscape structures found in the city, so the combined effects of wind and shade will also lead to interpretable results. Of the less expensive alternatives, plastic snow barriers have been proven effective windbreakers and used at nurseries and in agriculture (Jim, Mountain State Wholesale Nursery, pers. comm.). More expensive alternatives are fabric with smaller mesh size, able to reduce wind speed by 80%. These are also able to let light penetrate, minimizing the shade problem. Anemometers and data loggers (Campbell Scientific) will be placed in the wind protected area and the control area for a limited time to verify the effect of the wind barrier. The plants will be on an optimal watering schedule, and kept in pots to exclude confounding effects of soil type. The protocol for this setup is well established from our previous/ongoing research experiments.

<b>Figure 3: </b>
Proposed experimental setup. Each green object represents one brittlebush. The area is enclosed by poultry netting to exclude rabbits and ground squirrels. The bushes to the left are enclosed by 1.5m tall windbreak material. Wind direction is diurnal, thus one arrow represents day wind direction, while the opposite arrow represents direction of the night winds.

</p>

</p>
<p>

  Â 

</p>
<p>

  The experiment will be initiated in February, with the start of the growth season (Fig.1), and end in August. We will measure height, canopy diameter, length of longest stem/branch and average stem diameter on all plants each month. Comparing to initial measures, we predict that wind protected plants will be taller, have thinner stems, and overall larger biomass than unprotected plants. This difference will be highest in desert sites, and smallest in urban sites, with remnant sites in between. 

</p>
<p>

  Â 

</p>
<p>

  Since the results are directly measured, trends will be evident early in the season and we will be ready to analyze the data in June. With this balanced design, we will use repeated measures analysis of variance to analyze the data. We propose to present a conference manuscript in the fall of 2008.

<p>

  The topic of this proposal is strongly linked to the overall goal of CAP LTER and connects two integrated project areas (IPAs) Human Control of Biodiversity and Climate â?? Ecosystem Interactions. Linking descriptive research to experiments on underlying processes and dynamics was one of the strengths pointed out by the NSF site visiting team. By first discovering a pattern and then subsequently testing the mechanisms, this project is a continuation of this effort.

<b>1) Project Description</b>


</p>
<p>

  We are requesting a graduate Research Assistant (RA) for the summer 2008 to support surface energy balance measurements in the CAP region. The RA will assist in site selection of energy flux towers, logistical management of instruments and data analysis. The work is a prerequisite for a longer-term continuous energy flux data collection at representative sites in Phoenix neighborhoods and a desert site.

</p>
<p>

  The RA s work will directly contribute to the ??Climate and Ecosystem Interaction? and ??Fluxes of Materials and Socioecosystem Response? Integrative Project Areas by greatly advancing our understanding of atmospheric dynamics in the Phoenix metropolitan region. The energy balance measurements will potentially give much more accurate information then any other method on outdoor water use and the carbon balance on a neighborhood scale for typical neighborhoods/landscaping. The measurements will support mesoscale meteorological model validation that is used in CAP LTER s urban heat island, human and plant comfort, and also in air quality and deposition modeling studies.  In addition, the energy-balance measurements are of great utility for understanding the deposition of materials.

</p>
<p>

  Specifically measurements of surface momentum, latent and sensible heat fluxes and components of the radiation balance will be conducted. The heat storage flux will be determined as the residuum in the energy balance. Instruments will be mounted at 20-30 m high towers to ensure that measurements are taken in the constant flux layer. Typical Phoenix neighborhoods in terms of urban morphology and vegetation (predominantly desert vegetation or heavily irrigated) and a desert site (possibly the N-deposition project s LostDutchmanState Park site) will be selected. The sites have to adhere to stringent characteristics to ensure data quality.

</p>
We are pleased that Winston Chow, Tony Brazel s graduate student has an interest in working on this project. Winston previously conducted surface energy balance measurements in Singapore.

<b>Distribution of biomass- and fossil fuel-derived black carbon in CAP 200-point survey soils</b>


</p>

</p>
<p>

  
<b>Project Description</b>


</p>
<p>

  This project will investigate the distribution and composition of black carbon (BC) in soil samples collected as part of the CAP LTER 200-point Survey. Black carbon, also called charcoal or soot carbon is the product of incomplete organic matter combustion and is operationally defined along a broad continuum from slightly charred biomass to fully graphitic soot (Schmidt and Noack, 2000). This continuum also incorporates a large range in particle size-class, combustion temperature, reactivity, etc. Significant uncertainties exist in global and regional black carbon budgets and these uncertainties are related to the wide range of analytical techniques used to quantify BC, and to the lack of a consensus definition. None-the-less, BC has been shown to be a very large fraction of soil organic carbon (up to 30% by weight; Skjemstad et al. 2002). It is worth noting however, that 
none
 of the current information on BC in soils is based on urban soils or on arid-land soils.

</p>
<p>

  This project will also address the pervasive idea that BC is 
extremely
 recalcitrant. While black carbon s aromatic structure is inherently less reactive than other fresher organic molecules, the best budget estimates for black carbon in the environment do not balance with respect to inputs and losses. Current BC production rates are well known and large, yet, there is no evidence for any large sink for black carbon on land or in the oceans. This means that some fraction of the BC pool must be labile on relatively short time scales or mass balance would dictate implausibly large BC soil pools (Masiello and Druffel, 2003). Black carbon has been shown to be stabilized in soils by interaction with the mineral matrix, in particular with Ca
<sup>+2</sup>
 ions (Clough and Skjemstad, 2000) and there is also growing evidence that soil microbes can, under the right conditions, metabolize BC (Baldock and Smernik, 2002; Hockaday et al. 2006). The factors controlling BC storage in soils are currently very poorly understood; in particular, the roles of microbial and UV oxidation, and the influence of human land-use and management on BC biogeochemistry warrant further investigation (Czimczik and Masiello, 2007).

</p>
<p>

  This project will utilize thermo-chemical techniques as well as 
<sup>13</sup>
C-NMR and ESI-Mass Spectrometry molecular-level analyses (see Masiello, 2004 and references therein for a summary of analytical methods) to characterize the amount and form of black carbon in a selected set of the Survey 200 soil samples. These analyses can all be done on campus either in the Hartnett Laboratory or in the NMR facility in Chemistry and Biochemistry. Soil samples will be chosen that incorporate of range of land-use history, fire history, and proximity to the urban core. The Survey 200 soil samples, with their ancillary soil chemistry information are an excellent starting point for this project. I have spoken with N. Grimm and S. Earl about obtaining access to the Survey 200 soil samples and they have agreed to allow us to use these samples.

</p>
<p>

  This project relates directly to the CAP LTER Integrated Project Area: Fluxes of Materials and Socio-Ecosystem Response. The project is also relevant to the Land-Use and Land-Cover Change IPA. Specifically, black carbon is a significant component of soil carbon biogeochemical cycling. Because BC has both natural and anthropogenic sources it s distribution and composition in a growing urban region is very likely to be different than that found in a relatively undisturbed ecosystem. In addition, because black carbon has a long environmental lifetime, it may be possible (through careful sample selection) to investigate how the relative proportion of fire-derived and fossil fuel-derived black carbon has changed over the course of the development of the CAP urban ecosystem. Human activity is known to increase BC relative to non-black soil organic carbon both through land-use practices that either selectively remove soil organic matter (many agricultural practices) or land-use practices that increase the amount of BC present (actual burning and/or tillage of charcoal and ash; Czimczik and Masiello, 2007). The well-known land-use history (desert, agriculture, residential) of the Survey 200 sites is particularly important as it will allow a detailed comparison of BC among sites with different soil chemistry and soil organic carbon compositions. In addition, spatially explicity data on fire history and fire scarring corresponding with the 200-point Survey sites will provide a context in which to interpret the relative proportion of biomass-derived and fossil fuel-derived black carbon.

"292","Phase II: Institutional Drivers of Growth in Phoenix","<p>The purpose of this project is to analyze growth policy in the region since World War II, particularly the jurisdictional variation of water access, economic development, zoning/subdivision rules, and relevant state policies affecting urbanization in Phoenix. This project will expand an institutional database focused on growth policies in selected jurisdictions completed during the spring of 2008 and summer by Conley.</p>
<p>The primary focus of this work will be coupling institutional drivers of growth to LUCC. In order to complete this work, we need to create variables for use in econometric models of LUCC. Institutional variables collected during the spring and summer of 2008 will be coded for usage in an econometric model and prepared for geocoding. We also will expand interviews of stakeholders and institutional analysis to cities throughout the valley, beyond the selected cases of the summer. We used a similar approach linking institutional variables to parcel characteristics to better understand forest fragmentation in southern Indiana (Croissant, Munroe, and York 2005).</p>
<p>We also will begin a dialog with the Water IPA during the academic year to integrate relevant institutional variables that they have collected. During the spring 2008, Conley will have gathered information about municipal water extension decision-making. Conversion of land for residential uses is tied both to water and land policy, thus we believe a strong connection between the Water and LUCC IPAs through institutional variable collection and analysis is imperative.</p>
<p>Understanding the institutional context will strengthen the social dimensions of land use research being completed by CAP LTER, an area identified as needing development by the NSF Site Visit Team.  Furthermore, the archival research proposed by this project will provide information about relevant institutions affecting the history of development, a research area of priority highlighted in the Site Visit Report.

</p>
<p>

  
Timeline


</p>
<p>

  Beginning with the institutional database completed during the summer 2008, Conley will continue data collection on cities not selected for the summer case studies.  Interviews with stakeholders throughout the Valley will be completed throughout the fall and beginning of the spring semester.  Conley will also assist York in developing institutional variables for use in spatial statistics and econometric modeling throughout the year.  A paper on urban growth will be developed for presentation by Conley in the spring of 2009 at a national conference in a relevant area; most likely the Urban Affairs Association Conference.  The final products of this product will be a database of institutional variables affecting growth and an analysis of growth policy in the valley since World War II.

</p>
<p>

  
Data Release


</p>
<p>

  We request the summer to work with the institutional variables prior to their public release; we suggest that they may be made available in September 2009.

</p>
<p>

  
Relationship to LandUseLand Cover IPA


</p>
<p>

  During the year, we would like to consult with other LUCC researchers and begin coupling the institutional database with the LUCC data.  If there we are able to obtain GIS support, we would like to begin spatial econometric modeling in the 2008-2009 academic year.  If these resources are not available, York will search for support for this work in the following academic year of 2009-2010.  York has had experience working with geographers focused on LUCC while at the Center for Study of Institutions, Populations and Environmental Change and looks forward to the opportunity to work with LUCC researchers at CAP-LTER.

"294","Effect of hydrologic disturbances on urban drinking water systems","
<p>

  
Issue
: Hydrologic, and resulting hydraulic, disturbances result in pulses of nutrients and suspended material into the CAP-LTER study area.  One important constituent is turbidity (i.e., suspended sediment) because turbidity impacts operations at water treatment plants (there are over 15 in the CAP LTER study area serving over 2.5 million people).  In the spring of 2005 the City of Phoenix had to alert the public and post a boil-water warning because turbidity could not be completely removed within their treatment plants.  This caused concern and economic impacts to the general public, hospitals, restaurants, etc.  For water treatment plants operations and regulations, turbidity serves as a surrogate for the presence of pathogens in water.  Currently water treatment plants have little to no warning of when turbidity spikes will occur, their duration, or from where in the watershed they originate.  

</p>
<p>

  
<b> </b>


</p>
<p>

  
Purpose
: Develop relationships between turbidity spikes at multiple drinking water treatment facilities against Rainfall-Runoff-Streamflow during summer 2007 and work toward submitting a larger proposal related to: Using Dopler Radar and multiple sensors as an early warning tool for turbidity spikes in source water for water treatment plants.  

</p>
<p>

   

</p>
<p>

  
Hypothesized origins of turbidity in watershed
:  Turbidity can originate from at least 3 potential sources in the watershed:

</p>
<p>

  1)      Short-term turbidity pulses that result from short-duration / monsoon events (summertime) or multi-day rain events (winter/spring).  Most of this turbidity is caused by flows in Sycamore Creek that flows into the Verde River near Fountain Hills, and not rainfall in the upper watershed because 100% of that water is retained usually in the reservoirs.  We propose the following to predict these short-term events:

  2)      Intermediate duration turbidity events are caused by prolonged rains that affect turbidity levels in BartlettLake or LakePleasant.  Turbidity gauges should be installed in these lakes ?? or alternatively we could use satellite imaging to monitor these.

</p>
<p>

  3)      Longer-term turbidity events caused by high runoff from the higher elevation watersheds that fill the reservoirs or significantly increase turbidity because when a larger percentage of the reservoir volume is recent runoff.  Here stream gauges in the upper watersheds (Verde River, Salt River, Aqua Fria River, Bill Williams River) will be linked to common website and interpretive algorithms developed to compute volume loading of water to the reservoirs.  We will use current data on reservoir volumes from CAP and SRP to estimate the impact of each runoff event.  We will use historic relationships between streamflow and turbidity / suspended solids data to estimate turbidity in the reservoirs.  Again ?? real time or remote sensing data in the reservoirs would support this early warning process.

Connection with IPA
: Since hydrologic events (Water IPA) result in a pulse of turbidity (Fluxes IPA) the propose work relates to two LTER IPAs.  The research also addresses the idea of disturbances (i.e., hydrologic events) as a critical event within the LTER.  The research also provides a connection between hydro-geochemical processes (turbidity in runoff) and society (cost and ability to provide safe drinking water).

Benefit to LTER:
  The student and Prof. Westerhoff will engage at least 2 faculty previously not involved in LTER (Mark Schmeekle / Geography and Ron Calhoun/ Mechanical Engineering).

"295","Water and Salt Flux Modeling: Integration of LTER and DCDC Models","
<p>

  
Issue
: Whereas previous water-research efforts at CAP LTER have focused upon water and landscape management and a preliminary water budget for the metro area, we recognize a need for a more complex hydrologic cycle, with natural variability altered by the need to supply water for human activities and protect from floods. Controlled management activities shift the characteristic spatial and temporal variability of the system, leading to ecological consequences, human perceptions of change, and further institutional responses. This pattern can lead to vulnerabilities and unanticipated ecological consequences, inability to recognize key processes, and reduced capacity to withstand perturbations. 

</p>
<p>

   

</p>
<p>

  Over the past 1.5 years we (Westerhoff, Crittenden and 2 students (Zhang and Choi)) have created water and salt flux models for Scottsdale and currently working on Scottsdale, AZ.  This work has been successful and we can model ??where? water and salt go within city-scale spatial domains over time (model has a daily timestep).  We have begun interactive activities with DCDC where water coming into the metro-area is modeled on an annual timestep (no spatial resolution, fate of water, or water quality is currently included).

</p>
<p>

  
<b> </b>


</p>
<p>

  
Purpose
: We propose to build connects between our city-scale model and the DCDC regional-scale model to improve the applicability of models to LTER.

"296","Effects of stormwater infrastructure on urban hydrology and material export","<p>
Urbanization alters dramatically the hydrological and biogeochemical processes that govern the movement and transformation of materials through ecosystems.  Numerous studies have documented elevated runoff volume, peak flow rates, and contaminant loads in storm runoff corresponding to urban development.  However, the concomitant roles of urbanization intensity, configuration, and type, and the interaction of urbanization with climate variability in modulating stormwater quality are understudied and poorly understood. In this project, investigators seek to understand these relationships and feedbacks, which are critical to developing science-based strategies for the effective management of stormwater runoff and contaminants in urban environments. Four questions central to this project include: (1) How does urban stormwater infrastructure affect runoff dynamics in a desert city? (2) How does urbanization impact the processes controlling delivery of nitrogen (N) from runoff-generating areas? (3) What are the dominant sources of N in a desert city and what is the extent of internal N processing? and, (4) How do processes controlling the delivery and transport of materials (stormwater, dissolved and particulate matter) change across different spatial scales?  To address these questions, a series of nested catchments are instrumented to monitor flow and water quality in the Indian Bend Wash Catchment, Scottsdale, AZ. Catchments range in area from 6 to >17,000 ha, and represent different types and configurations of stormwater infrastructure. Catchments at the smaller spatial scales represent medium-density residential housing, while land cover becomes more heterogeneous at larger spatial scales. Monitoring has been ongoing since summer 2010. 
</p>","<p>A series of nested catchments is instrumented to monitor flow and water quality in the Indian Bend Wash Catchment, Scottsdale, AZ. Catchments range in area from 6 to >17,000 ha. At the smallest spatial scales, catchments of comparable size and land use represent different types of stormwater infrastructure, allowing investigators to isolate the effects of specific types of stormwater infrastructure on flow dynamics and material transport. Stormwater infrastructure is heterogeneous in catchments above 100 ha in size, allowing investigators to determine the scaling characteristics of runoff and material transport. At each sampling location, an ISCO 720 bubbler module (pressure transducer) measures flow depth, which is then converted to discharge using the Manning’s equation; an ISCO 6700 autosampler takes discrete samples of water from the channel (more frequently at the start of the event to capture the first flush of materials); and a tipping-bucket rain gauge measures rainfall at the catchment outlet. After every event samples are collected and processed in the laboratory for analysis of N species (ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, total dissolved nitrogen and total nitrogen), P species (dissolved phosphate, total phosphorus), chloride, dissolved organic carbon, multiple cations, and suspended sediment and organic matter. These analyses are carried out in the Goldwater Environmental laboratory at ASU. Collaborators at Purdue University (Greg Michalski and Kristin Riha) are analyzing a subset of samples collected for multiple stable isotopes (?15N, ?18O and ?17O) to determine the source of nitrogen. For the past year precipitation has been collected across the sites for discrete events and has been analyzed for N species and multiple stable isotopes.  </p>",NULL
"297","Socio-Ecological Dimensions of Water Use and Management ","
<p>

  In order to continue my CAP LTER work in two distinct research areas, I am requesting two months summer salary for 2008.  The first request is to support my LTER research, funded through a Social Science Supplement grant (with co-PI S. Hall), to answer the following research question:  
What are the factors that drive residential landscape management decisions, and how do these practices affect ecological processes, specifically biogeochemistry?
 With the social survey completed and field work underway this spring (including observation surveys, soil sampling and in-depth interviews), we will have gathered a variety of data to allow us to conduct analyses and write-up the results during the summer months. Since the supplemental grant did not allow funds for PI salaries, I am requesting salary support for the time I ve dedicated to this project.  It is also noteworthy to mention that our preliminary results will be presented at the International Symposium on Society and Resource Management in June, for which I ve organized a couple of sessions on ‘residential landscapes as urban ecosystems  with the BES, PIE and FCE LTER sites.  The second month of summer salary I am requesting is to support continued analysis and distribution of findings (in peer-reviewed journals) from the Phoenix Area Social Survey. In particular, my PASS research is aimed at understanding 
how ecological concern varies for specific water-related risks and across spatial scales (local neighborhoods vs. the valley-wide region), what values and beliefs (anthropocentric—biocentric, self-enhancing—altruistic) underlie perceptions about the causes (self-induced, human and natural) of ecological risks and approaches to mitigating them (regulatory, economic-based and otherwise)
. While my focus is primarily on water scarcity, I am also working with others from the PASS team (S. Harlan, A. Wutich, D. White) to examine these issues across an array of environmental domains including air quality, climate conditions, and land development.  As junior faculty, summer salary support for these two endeavors would be immensely helpful in allocating my time to advance CAP LTER research, especially pertaining to the Water IPA and interdisciplinary understanding of urban ecosystems. 

</p>

<p>

  This request is not for additional research with a new design, but rather for support of the time I am dedicating to CAP LTER through on-going projects.  As projects requiring time-consuming survey development and implementation as well as extensive field work, summer salary support would be incredibly useful for allocating my time to the distribution of information produced through these initiatives.

"300","Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungal diversity and functioning in urban desert remnants and surround deserts","
<p>

  Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) form symbiotic relationships with plant roots and are of great importance in ecosystem health and functionality. This proposal presents a plan to evaluate AMF functioning and biodiversity associated with woody plants and cacti/succulents located at two Survey 200 sites that are urban desert remnants and compare these functions in similar plants located at two Survey 200 sites located in the peripheral Sonoran desert surrounding Phoenix.  Based on previous work with arthropods and birds, I propose that AMF functioning and diversity will be altered and possibly reduced in desert remnants in comparison to the surrounding desert. The experimental methods include the analysis of root colonization to measure the degree of AMF infection in plants and the identification of spores to determine AMF composition.  Research funding will allow me to complete the first phase of this project this summer and present preliminary results at the Annual Western Mycorrhizal Meeting in August.

</p>


","
<p>

  Several studies have shown that biodiversity and its richness could be radically affected in urban ecosystems in comparison to preserved peripheral communities (Czech et al. 2000). McKinney (2002) suggested that two possible strategies to encourage the conservation of native species are the preservation of urban remnants and the restoration of habitats. Nevertheless, these strategies could fail in the attempt to preserve the biodiversity of native species. For instance, non-native invasive plants and animals can colonize urban preserves and reduce the ability of urban remnants to support native species (McKinney 2002).  Biotic communities other than plants and mammals and birds might also be impacted in urban preserves. A recent study of arthropod communities in peripheral deserts and deserts remnants reported different types of species composition between peripheral deserts and desert remnants (Cook and Faeth 2006).  

</p>
<p>

  Mycorrhizal fungi are important microbiota that form an often mutualistic symbiosis with the roots of terrestrial plants; where fungi receive carbon compounds from the hosts and fungi aid in mineral uptake. Mycorrhizas confer many benefits to the hosts such as improved absorption of soil s nutrients and water, resistance to pathogens, better establishment and survival in stressful environments, and tolerance to drought (Brundett 1999). Bills (2006) made some preliminary conclusions that there may be noticeable differences between AMF species (the most widespread type of mycorrhizas) found in his study of the deserts surrounding Phoenix and AMF species found by Cousins et al. (2003) in urban desert sites in the Phoenix metropolitan area. Stabler et al. (2001) found that AMF colonization was greater in native trees growing in desert remnants than native trees growing in residential areas. They also reported more diverse types of AMF species associated with native trees at remnant Sonoran Desert sites than those at nearby residential landscapes.

</p>
<p>

  This research proposal presents a plan to evaluate AMF biodiversity at two urban desert remnants sites and make comparison to diversity at two peripheral deserts (Sonoran Desert) sites. The AMF relationships of woody and succulent plants present at all sites will also be evaluated. My hypothesis is that AMF diversity and colonization associated with plants growing in urban desert remnants sites will be different than diversity and colonization of plants growing in the desert sites surrounding the Phoenix metropolitan area. AMF diversity will be measured using the identification of spores to determine AMF composition and species richness and AMF functioning will be determined by the analysis of root colonization to measure the degree of AMF infection in plants.

</p>
<p>

  Four research sites that were part of the CAP-LTER Survey 200 project were identified with similar vegetation and edaphic characteristics for use in this study.  The four sites include:  

</p>
<p>

  U131 North Mountain Preserve (Urban desert remnant)

</p>
<p>

  U201 South Mountain Park (Urban desert remnant)

</p>
<p>

  AD101 McDowell Mountain Regional Park (Peripheral desert)

</p>
<p>

  AF141 Tonto National Forest/Usery Mountain (Peripheral desert)

</p>
<p>

  Permission was obtained to collect soil sample at each site in the winter of 2007. I completed the collection of soil samples at these sites during February 2008. In order to select plants for soil sampling, a 50 meter transect (with an East to West direction) was centered at the GPS-located center point for these sites. Soil samples were collected from the nearest woody and succulent plant at 5 meter intervals along the transect.   Surface debris was removed and soil was collected to a depth of approximately 10 cm with a metal trowel and placed into self-sealing plastic bags. Samples were stored at 4° C until analysis. Twenty soil samples were collected from the root zone of 10 woody plants and 10 succulent plants (including cacti) at each site for a total of 80 samples.

</p>
<p>

  I am currently processing the samples in the laboratory by removing roots from each sample. Roots are fixed in ethanol prior to staining with trypan blue (needed to assess root colonization). A subsample of soil sample is used to set up trap cultures that will be grown in the greenhouse.  This technique has been shown to promote AMF spore production in desert soils (Stutz and Morton 1996).

</p>
<p>

  Trap cultures will be established following the protocol reported by Stutz and Morton (1996). Sudan grass (Sorghum sudanese) seeds will be planted into 656 ml Deepots using a planting media 1:1:1 of sterilized silica sand #20 and #12 and sample soil. Trap cultures will be grown in the greenhouse at ASU Polytechnic campus and will be watered at 1 to 3 times per week over the course of 3 months until flowering and subsequent dry down.

</p>
<p>

  AMF colonization will be assessed by staining roots in trypan blue using a modification of the method of Koske and Gemma (1989) with the potassium hydroxide concentration adjusted for woody and succulent plant roots.  Percent root colonization will be determined using the magnified intersections method of McGonigle et al. (1990).  The spore analysis will be done from a 100 cm
<sup>3</sup>
 subsample of the Deepots soil using wet sieving and a sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Daniels and Skipper 1982). Spores will be washed into a petri dish for examination with the stereomicroscope.  Healthy spores will be separated into different morphotypes based on shape, color, size, surface conditions, spore contents and no evidence of parasitism. Spores will be mounted on slides in polyvinyl alcohol lactic acid-glycerol (PLVG) (Koske and Tessier 1983) and PVLG mixed 1:1 (v/v) with Melzer s reagent to be compared with voucher specimens and descriptions from the International Culture Collection of Arbuscular and Vesicular-Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (INVAM) (Morton et al. 1993). Species richness will be measured as the numbers of AMF species present at each site.

</p>
<p>

  Based on previous research with arthropods and AM fungi, I expect that AMF diversity and colonization associated with plants growing in urban desert remnants sites will be reduced in comparison to diversity and colonization of plants growing in the desert sites surrounding the Phoenix metropolitan area.  Possible negative impacts on AMF communities and root colonization associated with urbanization include soil disturbance during development and increases in atmospheric nitrogen deposition, air and soil pollutants, average ambient temperature (urban heat island effect) and soil compaction (Pickett et al. 2001, Grimm and Redman 2004).  

</p>
<p>

  Although the vast majority of terrestrial plants have been shown to form a symbiotic association in their roots with mycorrhizal fungi (Brundrett 1999), little is known about the impact of urbanization on mycorrhizal fungal diversity and functioning of native plants in urban remnants.  This study would add significantly to our knowledge in this area by providing invaluable information about how urban development affects the colonization of roots of native woody and succulent plant species in desert remnants. There is no evidence of similar studies of woody and succulent native plant species in urban remnants. There are few published reports about levels of colonization of cacti in the Sonoran desert.

</p>
<p>

   I plan to present this part of my research results (root colonization) at the Annual Western Mycorrhizal Meeting in August. This meeting is one of the most important annual scientific meetings about mycorrhizas in US. This year s meeting will take place in Flagstaff, AZ and is a gathering of researchers not only from the West but also from other sections of the US.  Once I have completed the second part of my study on AMF species diversity and composition, significant new information will be added to existing understanding of AMF diversity and composition in the Phoenix urban ecosystem and the surrounding deserts (Cousins et al. 2003 and Bills 2006).

"312","Microbial degradation of non-point carbon deposition in urban soil","
<p>

  Rapid urbanization has increased emissions of and deposition of combustion-derived carbon compounds to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (Van Metre et al. 2000).  Although mechanical and chemical techniques have been created to remove pollutants, high costs of implementation have led to increased interest in microbial bioremediation as a cost-effective and efficient alternative (Li et al. 2000).  Soil heterotrophic microorganisms are key players in organic matter decomposition and nutrient turnover, and they have been shown to be effective in degradation of numerous anthropogenic pollutants (Kiyohara et al. 1982).  For example, microorganisms have been used effectively for decades in concentrated sites of pollution such as oil tanker spills and town gasworks leaks (Atlas 1981, Bidaud and Tran-Minh 1998).  The negative health and environmental consequences of contaminated sites such as these have stimulated regulation and focused attention on point-sources as high priority areas for remediation.  However, the rise in motor vehicle usage and low-density urban development patterns have also turned attention to the impacts of unregulated, non-point, diffuse pollution that occurs at lower intensities but covers larger areas (Johnsen and Karlson 2007).  Many compounds in non-point, combustion-derived pollution are known to be toxic in high concentrations, but little is known about their health and environmental consequences in urban areas (Mielke et al. 2004).  Due to these concerns, my project will explore the interaction between soil microbial metabolism and the urban environment.  My central research questions are: What types of non-point carbon pollution enter soils in the Phoenix metropolitan area, and how do soil microbial communities respond to these inputs?  To accomplish my goal, my objectives are to: 1) characterize and quantify urban diffuse pollution that is entering the soil, 2) explore soil microbial ability of degrading carbon based compounds from non-point sources, 3) investigate soil microbial community response to combustion-derived and other types of anthropogenic pollutants, and 4) evaluate biodegradation ability of microorganisms previously exposed to contaminants near a roadway compared to microorganisms distant to diffuse deposition from a roadway.  My research will be the first to estimate the importance of non-point carbon pollution in soils of the Phoenix metropolitan area and will elucidate the regulating services provided by urban soil microorganisms that may degrade pollutants from human activity.

Introduction-


</p>
<p>

   

</p>
<p>

           The human population has increased rapidly over the last several decades and is projected to reach 9.2 billion by 2050 (United Nations 2007).  While most growth historically occurred in rural areas, over 50% of the world s population now lives in cities.  Thus, the urban atmosphere will increasingly influence the global land area.  Humans release numerous compounds into the atmosphere such as nutrients and other chemicals that deteriorate environmental quality and can be toxic to humans and other organisms (US EPA 1998).  Many of these compounds are derived from combustion and are identified in the 1990 US Clean Air Act and the 1995 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, including 188 compounds deemed “hazardous” by the U.S. EPA and the United Nations Environment Programme (US EPA 1998, UNEP 2005).  Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), a subset included in both the hazardous and persistent pollutant lists, have been reported to be in higher concentrations in locations with industrial and transportation use compared to rural areas (Ma et al. 2005).  These pollutants are transported through the atmosphere as gaseous aerosols or adsorbed to particulate matter and can deposit to surfaces in both near and distant ecological systems.  Despite the significance of this concern, there is a considerable gap in our understanding of the effect and fate of PAHs and other atmospheric pollutants in urban areas (Mielke et al. 2004,Wild and Jones 1995). 

</p>
<p>

  
 


</p>
<p>

              Soil microorganisms have a major impact on ecosystem properties and processes, such as regulating nutrient cycling, and they are also capable of degrading or ‘detoxifying  petroleum-based and other complex carbon compounds from industrial activity (Van Elsas 2007).  Soil chemoorganotrophic microbes in natural systems utilize dead organic matter, carbohydrates, and other carbon-based molecules for energy gain.  Although PAH and other combustion derived compounds are energy-rich, their complex structures can act as stressors to microbial communities and may thus cause selection for resistant individuals (Garland and Mills 1991).  For example, many studies confirm microbial evolution due to competitive trophic responses by comparing soil microbes in contaminated and uncontaminated sites (Ahn et al. 2006).  Most often, contamination decreases species richness and diversity because it selects for unique species that are able to utilize foreign carbon compounds while decreasing abundance of microbes that cannot use these carbon sources (Joynt et al. 2006).  Moreover, a few studies have shown that microorganisms are capable of degrading products of atmospheric pollution such as low and high molecular weight PAHs, transforming them into non-toxic products (Kiyohara 1992, Kanaly and Harayama 2000).  Despite the clear benefits of these organisms, few studies have explored the composition and function of heterotrophic microbial communities that are exposed to non-point PAH pollution in urban soils.

</p>
<p>

   

</p>
<p>

              Ecosystems within and surrounding the Phoenix metropolitan area are increasingly exposed to atmospheric pollutants from combustion.  For example, Maricopa County recently earned an ‘F  grade for ozone air pollution and a ‘D  for particulate matter from the American Lung Association (ALA 2007).  Because the carbon content of native desert and xeric soils is typically low, novel carbon compounds from human activity may be readily detected in soils within the Phoenix airshed.  Furthermore, non-point combustion inputs may serve as an energy source to these carbon-starved, desert microorganisms with potentially large consequences for microbial community structure and functioning.  In my research, I hope to provide insight into this human-ecosystem interaction by investigating the interactions between urban soil microorganisms and carbon pollution deposition in CAP-LTER soils.

               Ecosystems that border inter-state highways are ideal places to explore the importance of atmospheric carbon deposition and metabolism by urban soil microorganisms.  I will choose study locations in twelve native desert or xeric sites near roads with similar traffic loads (average number of vehicles on the road per day) within the Phoenix metropolitan core (N = 12).  All sites will be similar with respect to climate, parent material, age of freeway, slope, and biota.  In order to explore the interacting effect of anthropogenic carbon deposition and natural carbon inputs of plants, I will stratify my sampling by patch type, including both inter-plant spaces and underneath roadside desert shrubs.  In each site, I will collect soils in inter-plant spaces along two parallel transects separated 3 m away from one another leading away from the side of the road, at intervals of 0.5 m, 2 m, 5m, 10m, and 25m.  Because the distribution of roadside plants is not homogeneous, I will take soil samples from under shrubs at various distances from the road.  At each sampling point, I will collect and homogenize two soil cores to 5 cm depth.  A total of 180 soil samples will be compiled from twelve roads, five distances at each road, and three transects each (two in inter-plant spaces, one under plants).

<p>

  
<b>Research Question 1</b>
: Do combustion derived organic compounds enter urban soil?  If so, what is their composition, and where are they deposited to?

</p>
<p>

   

</p>
<p>

  
Hypothesis
<b>: </b>
Petrogenic and pyrogenic compounds will be found in soils in decreasing concentrations from roadways.  These compounds will include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and possibly other types of hydrocarbons from fossil fuel combustion.

</p>
<p>

   

</p>
<p>

  
Approach
<b>: </b>
Carbon-based compounds will be extracted from the soil samples, separated using chromatography techniques, and characterized by mass spectrometry.  Most of the organic compounds chosen for analysis are from the EPA pollutant priority list and will be identified based on previously documented standards (Rossi et al. 1984).

</p>
<p>

  
 


</p>
<p>

  
Prediction
<b>: </b>
Concentrations of detected carbon will be highest at 0.5 m near the road and quickly decreasing away from the road (Figure 1).  Furthermore, I expect low molecular weight compounds (i.e. naphthalene, fluorene) to diffuse out to a farther distance than high molecular weight compounds (i.e. benzo-a-pyrene).  

</p>
<p>

   

</p>
<p>

  
Rationale
<b>:</b>
 Fossil-fuel combustion leads to formation of many types of aerosols and organic compounds.  Each group of pollutants has unique physicochemical properties, such as density of the created molecule and ability to adsorb to other emitted particles that may influence deposition patterns (Schauer et al. 2003).

</p>
<p>

   

</p>
<p>

  


</p>
<p>

  
 


</p>
<p>

  
<b>Research question 2</b>
:
 
Do microorganisms in urban soils have the ability to degrade diffusely deposited organic pollutants?  If so, do microbes from different urban locations process carbon differently?

</p>
<p>

  
 


</p>
<p>

  
Hypothesis
:
 I hypothesize that non-point carbon deposition from fossil fuel combustion selects for microbial communities that have the ability to degrade urban carbon compounds.  Select groups of soil microorganisms will be able to metabolize combustion-derived deposition similarly to naturally-occurring organic compounds in soils.  Thus, microbial communities in soils beneath plants will be better adapted to metabolize PAH and other compounds compared to microbes from soils in inter-plant spaces.

</p>
<p>

   

</p>
<p>

  
Predictions
: I predict that microorganisms from near road soil will have higher rates of respiration (figure 2) and have higher biomass after addition of carbon-based compounds compared to microbes far from the road.  Furthermore, under-shrub microorganisms from near road soils will have higher rates of respiration and higher biomass after addition of carbon-based compounds compared to under-shrub microbes far from the road.  Under-shrub microbial response will be higher than activity in inter-plant soils.

</p>
<p>

   

</p>
<p>

  
Approach
<b>:</b>
 
Microbial utilization of carbon can be measured as microbial activity in the form of biomass change and as microbial respiration (Degens and Harris 1997, Margesin et al. 2003).  I will measure microbial respiration (as CO
<sub>2</sub>
) after incubating soil with: 1) water (control) and 2) water with various carbon additions ranging from simple carbohydrates (i.e. sugar) to more complex PAHs (i.e. phenanthrene) as the treatment.

</p>
<p>

   

</p>
<p>

  
Rationale
<b>:</b>
 An environmental disturbance such as contamination can supply carbon and energy for a microbial community.  As a result, evolution will occur through competitive trophic responses and selection for microbes that can utilize the novel carbon resource (Van Elsas 2007, Johnsen et al. 2006).  Moreover, due to diverse metabolic and enzymatic abilities, soil microorganisms that are able to utilize naturally occurring forms of carbon (i.e. carbohydrates, carboxylic acids) may also be able to acquire energy and carbon from more complex, anthropogenic compounds (Van Elsas 2007, Madigan and Martinko 2006).

"318","Effects of urbanization on avian species richness in the Phoenix metropolitan area: Patterns in native vegetation remnants","
<p>

  Habitat loss and fragmentation are important causes of loss of biodiversity.  Urbanization is an important driver of these changes in habitat amount and configuration. Birds are ideal study organisms for estimating the effects of urbanization on species richness.  If habitat loss and fragmentation are limiting the avifauna community, it is likely that less mobile organisms are being affected as well.  I used a stratified random sampling approach to assess the species richness of passerines in sixteen native vegetation remnants in the Phoenix metropolitan area.  Previous CAP-LTER work on mapping the dominant vegetation of these areas was used as a guide for placing sampling points.  One breeding season and one winter season of data collection have been completed.  Data collection in the 2008 breeding season remains to be completed.  After all data has been collected, landscape variables in the study area such as fragment size, fragment edge, fragment isolation and land use surrounding each fragment at multiple scales will be calculated in ArcGIS.  Overall species richness and guild specific species richness will be regressed against landscape variables in a traditional landscape ecology approach.  To further examine the community composition of fragment avifauna communities, analysis of nestedness, a technique from community ecology will be employed.  These two techniques, used together, will shed important light on the effects of fragmentation by urbanization in the CAP-LTER study area.

</p>
<p>

  
<b> </b>


</p>


","
<p>

  
<b>Introduction:</b>


</p>
<p>

              Habitat loss is widely recognized as one of the premier factors affecting biodiversity and species richness.  At a certain threshold, however, fragmentation becomes an important factor as well (Andren 1994; Drolet, Desrochers et al. 1999; Trzcinski, Fahrig et al. 1999; Hanski and Ovaskainen 2000; Fahrig 2003).  In recent years, the pervasive human migration to cities in places across the globe has made urbanization an increasingly significant driver of habitat change (Marzluff 2005).  Birds are ideal study organisms, from a community ecology standpoint, for estimating the effects of urbanization species richness and diversity.  If habitat loss and fragmentation are limiting the avifauna community, it is likely that less mobile organisms, with similar habitat requirements, are being affected as well.

</p>
<p>

              From a landscape ecological perspective habitat quality and the nature and heterogeneity of the matrix are also important to patterns of species richness and the processes that produce them (Watson, Whittaker et al. 2005; Kupfer, Malanson et al. 2006).  Human disturbance and food supplementation, modifications of the composition and structure of vegetation, various edge effects and increased predators both natural and domestic can all have effects on the quality of habitat in remnant vegetation fragments (Chace and Walsh 2004; Blewett and Marzluff 2005; Atchison and Rodewald 2006; Platt and Lill 2006).  A number of studies have attempted to determine to what degree and at what scale surrounding land use dictates the nature and severity of these habitat quality drivers (Melles, Glenn et al. 2003; Stratford and Robinson 2005; Hostetler and Knowles-Yanez 2003).  Even if the quality of focal habitats is not severely affected, the character of the matrix surrounding these habitats can be important.  Resource availability and mortality within the matrix have been shown, through modeling efforts, to affect the extinction thresholds of some species (Fahrig 2001).  This study will seek to determine how the size, shape, isolation and surrounding land use of native vegetation fragments in mountain preserves affect avian richness and community composition in the Phoenix metropolitan area.  

</p>
<p>

  
<b>Proposed Methods:</b>


</p>
<p>

              A stratified random sampling approach was taken to assess avian species richness and community composition in native vegetation remnants that roughly form a transect from north to south across the Phoenix Metropolitan area.  In a 2006 CAP-LTER supported dissertation, Art Stiles mapped these areas and others based upon the dominant vegetation (Stiles 2006).  Using Hawth s tools in ArcGIS, I placed random points within the boundaries of each remnant and randomly chose one point for each vegetation type identified within the remnant (Figure 1).  At each chosen point, open radius point counts have been completed using CAP-LTER protocol. These 15-minute counts were completed at each point in April 2007, May 2007, December 2007, and January 2008.  Two counts remain to be completed in April and May 2008. The December and January counts and the two April counts will be directly comparable to existing CAP-LTER data about bird diversity in other land use types, such as urban and residential.

</p>
<p>

              Most counts are completed by the author and one volunteer undergraduate research assistant.  Some counts are completed by skilled amateur birders associated with local chapters of the Audubon Society.  Each of these volunteers are given an electronic quiz of identifying common birds found in the preserves by sight and sound and their scores of 90% or higher are recorded before their data is used.  

</p>
<p>

   

</p>
<p>

  
Figure 1. Native vegetation remnants included in this study are in parks and preserves across the Phoenix metropolitan area. There are between one and four sampling points in each fragment dependent upon the dominant vegetation types present.

</p>
<p>

              Using data collected during the past 18 months in addition to data to be collected late this spring, this research will address how the size, shape, spatial isolation and time since isolation, and surrounding land use affects the richness and composition of the avifauna communities in native vegetation fragments in the CAP-LTER study area.  These variables will be quantified using ArcGIS.  Using the Maricopa Association of Government s 2000 land use map, buffers of multiple sizes will be drawn around native vegetation fragments and the percent cover of different land uses within them calculated..  They will be used as independent variables in regressions against aggregate species richness for each fragment separately for the breeding and winter seasons.   Separate analyses of a variety of feeding and nesting guilds will also be completed to determine what life history characteristics may make desert species particularly sensitive to fragmentation by urbanization.  Size of the fragment is likely to have an affect at the range of sizes that is commensurate to the home range size of birds included in the analysis.  Edge effects produced by different shapes of different fragments are unlikely to have a relationship with aggregate richness at the spatial scales this study addresses.  If bird mobility between preserves is limited, then isolation will be predictive of species richness.  If the vegetation community changes in ways that are relevant to breeding birds as time since isolation increases (Stiles 2006), there will be a relationship between time since isolation and species richness during the breeding season, but not the winter season, as suggested by Clark (2006).  Surrounding land use is likely to have different effects on species richness at different scales.

</p>
<p>

              Analysis of nestedness can be applied to this research to further examine the composition of fragment communities.  Often, communities in habitat fragments that are all derived from one, once unfragmented, community will show a nested pattern (Ganzhorn and Eisenbeiszlig 2001).  As species are progressively lost from the community based on their tolerance to the effects of fragmentation as individual habitat fragments are isolated, a nested pattern develops. A nested community is indicative of fragments being truly isolated by a hostile matrix, since, if individuals were moving between fragments, one would expect the communities in fragments to be evenly mixed (Ganzhorn and Eisenbeiszlig 2001).  Alternatively, a nested pattern can be indicative of the nestedness of habitats within fragments (Fleishman et al. 2007).  Initial analysis of nestedness results, using data collected in April and May 2007 under a CAP-LTER research assistantship, were presented at the 2008 CAP-LTER poster symposium.  They suggest that the fragment communities in this study are significantly nested.

</p>
<p>

               Further analysis of nestedness using more data will yield more robust results.  For a more direct consideration of landscape variables, sites can be ordered, in a sites/species matrix, by various characteristics of native vegetation fragments and the nestedness of that matrix statistically tested.  If significant nestedness is found, it can be inferred that the ordering variable is important to determining the species composition of the fragment community (Fleishman et al. 2007).  Comparisons of the results from the landscape ecological regression technique and analysis of nestedness, a technique of community ecology, should be particularly illuminating.

</p>
<p>

  
<b>Scientific Importance and Relevance to CAP-LTER:</b>


</p>
<p>

              Generally, we assume that native vegetation remnants in the form of parks and preserves increase urban biodiversity and improve the urban ecosystem.  Through both  community ecology and landscape ecology approaches, this research addresses whether the native vegetation fragments contained within the metropolitan area s mountain preserves do, indeed, serve this function and what characteristics of the native vegetation fragments make them most effective with respect to biodiversity preservation, particularly of bird species.  The  results will be useful to urban planners to more precisely understand what makes a “good” preserve as they must often justify taking this land away from more economically lucrative uses.

</p>
<p>

              More specifically, this research will add to the growing body of literature on birds in urban environments.  Researchers have found that, when studied along a rural-to-urban gradient, bird species richness peaks at some intermediate level of development because some native species persist there while synantropic species are also present.  The pattern of changes in community composition with urbanization are less clear.  Various studies have concluded that species are excluded from urban habitats based on feeding guild, nesting guild or even body size.  By conducting separate analyses on guilds and identifying specific species that do or do not contribute to the nestedness of fragment communities, this work will shed important light on this issue.  There are also relatively few studies of urban birds in desert landscapes (but see Germaine 1998; Hostetler and Knowles-Yanez 2003, Green and Baker 2003) and none that the author is aware of that use analysis of nestedness to examine species in native vegetation fragements.

</p>
<p>

  
<b>Timeframe:</b>


</p>
<p>

              Mornings during the month of May will be devoted to bird surveys for the final sampling period.  Afternoons will be used to record data and incorporate it into an existing GIS.  Subsequent months will be devoted to calculating landscape variables, regression analyses and analysis of nestedness.  Dr. Jianguo Wu, would be an ideal CAP-LTER scientist to work with on this project due to his familiarity with this project and expertise in landscape ecology.  Scheduling time to work with Dr. Wu during the months of June, July and August would be flexible.  Results will be presented at the 2008 Society for Conservation GIS Conference.

"319","Land Fragmentation and Institutional Drivers of Growth","
<p>Explosive population growth and increasing demand for rural homes and lifestyles fueled exurbanization and urbanization in the western USA over the past decades. Using National Land Cover Data we analyzed land fragmentation trends in five southwestern cities associated with Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and observed two general fragmentation trends: expansion of the urbanized area leading to fragmentation in the exurban and peri-urban regions and decreased fragmentation associated with infill in the previously developed urban areas. Our work highlights the importance of understanding land use decision-making drivers in concert and throughout time, as historic decisions leave legacies on landscapes that continue to affect land form and function, a process often forgotten in a region and era of blinding change.
</p>","<p>There are four research intiatives in this project: cross-site study of southwestern urbanization, assessment of National Land Cover Data for studies of urbanization, methodological advancement for urban fragmentation analyses, and a coupled fragmentation, biodvierstiy, and sociodemographic analysis. In our cross site study with Konza Prairie (Manhattan, KS), Short Grass Steppe (Fort Collins, CO,) Sevilleta (Albuquerque, NM) and Jornada (Las Cruces, NM) using the literature and local expert opinion, we identified five relevant drivers&ndash;water provisioning, population dynamics, transportation, topography, and institutions&ndash;that shape land use decision-making and fragmentation in the southwest. In order to assess the relative importance of each driver on urbanization, we linked historical site-specific driver information obtained through literature reviews and archival analyses to the observed fragmentation patterns. In a subsequent studies of Phoenix, we assessed the applicability and accuracy of National Land-cover Database (NLCD)&mdash;a widely used land-cover dataset&mdash;to detect and measure urban growth and land fragmentation patterns in the relatively tree-less desert biome of the US Southwest and demonstrated that NLCD is a reliable data source for measuring land-use in the southwest, even in low-density environments.  A third study of Phoenix led to a methodological innovation for identification of an appropriate moving window size for fragmentation analyses. A fourth study is currently underway explores the effects of land composition and land fragmentation on bird biodiversity in the Phoenix metropolitan area. Pearson correlation and multiple regressions were conducted to build models of bird biodiversity based on land composition and fragmentation at multiple scales. To strengthen the models, surface indices such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and Built-up index computed from the remote sensing images, as well as social-economic factors extracted from census tract data are also applied. By combining qualitative analyses of social-ecological driver, fragmentation analyses, and ecological data, we move toward an improved understanding of cities, urban geography, and urbanization and provide key insights for the human modification framework widely used in land change science.</p>",NULL
"320","Tracing the historical origins of lead with isotopic fractions","
<p>

Our preliminary data show that the distribution of Pb in the Maricopa County is more correlated with traffic data in the past than data in the present, which might be due to the usage of leaded gasoline and paint before the 1980’s. Since Pb from different origins has varied isotopic compositions, isotope ratios of the 200-point samples might vary according to the changing landscapes. Therefore, an isotopic study of the fractions of 207Pb/206Pb and 208Pb/206Pb using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is proposed to trace the historical lead input into the environment.

</p>

","
<p>

Preliminary data:
</p>
<p>

 
In our study, top soil samples (top 10 cm) from the 2005 200-point survey were analyzed for bulk trace elemental concentrations with ICP-MS, and their spatial distributions were plotted using ArcGIS software and analyzed with geostatistical method kriging1. Spatial variation of Pb concentrations and enrichment factors show strong urban correlations (Figure 1 and 2). The enrichment factor for Pb is defined as the ratio of Pb concentration and concentration of one major element little affected by human activity from the sample, divided by the ratio of Pb concentration and concentration of that major element in the fresh soil or rock that is free of human input2,3. It is widely used to assess the anthropogenic input of trace element in the environment2,3,4. Usually Al is used as the normalizing major element, and crustal average rock concentrations are used as values of the fresh rock free of contaminates2. Enrichment factors that are close to one indicate little human input, while numbers much bigger than one suggest strong human influence2. The crustal data of Pb and Al were used to calculate the enrichment factor of Pb in the 200-point sample. With increasing Pb concentrations in soil, we have generally increasing enrichment factors (Figure 2), which further confirms that the pattern of Pb is strongly correlated with the urban evolution.
</p>
<p>

  
Toxic Release Inventory was obtained from the EPA website6 and compared with Pb distributions (Figure 3). It appears that these point sources shown on the map might not be a major contributor of Pb due to some offset from the hot spots exhibited by the samples. Annual daily traffic count data from the year 1970 to 2004 were collected from the Maricopa Association of Governments and city websites7, assembled in ArcGIS, and calculated for traffic densities in the areas where the traffic information is available. The analyzed traffic map for 2004 (Figure 4) exhibits a similar pattern as that of Pb spatial distribution, but when traffic data distilled on each sampling point is regressed against Pb concentration on that same point, the relationship is weak. In contrast, the traffic map for 1972 (Figure 5) have a stronger correlation with these Pb data, and based on which we might hypothesize that the Pb in the present soil is still partially heritage of the past traffic, when leaded gasoline was not yet banned. It was estimated that even given the 2004 traffic volume and emission factors of current gasoline8, an average of 0.013lb of Pb will be released each year for every kilometer of road in the city. From the research of Loranger et al.9 about the emission of leaded gasoline, the releasing of Pb from traffic in the past could be much bigger. In addition to Pb emitted from gasoline, brake and tire dust from vehicles was also reported to be a source of urban Pb10. Other sources accompanying the expansion of the city, such as usage of leaded paint in the past, can also be a factor11,12. In order to specify the sources of Pb and trace its behavior in the environment through time, an isotope study of Pb fraction is proposed.
</p>
<p>

 
Experimental design:
</p>
<p>

 
	Studying isotope fractions of 204Pb/206Pb, 207Pb/206Pb, and 208Pb/206Pb is a major approach to trace the sources of Pb in recent researches11-15. Lead from gasoline can have an isotopic composition that is different from Pb in paint, and they both can be different from bedrock background geology13,14. The complexion about tracing these isotopic fractions to their sources is that gasoline and paint from different made can have large isotopic fraction ranges and this can sometimes overlap each other if we only look at one isotopic ratio15. The usual way to solve this problem is to compare the ratios of two isotope fractions, such as plotting 207Pb/206Pb with 208Pb/206Pb, and Pb from different sources can fall into significantly different positions on the graph12,15. 
	In this study, given the methods used by Prapaipong16, 207Pb/206Pb and 208Pb/206Pb will be determined. NIST SRM 981 common Pb standard will be used to test the accuracy and reproducibility of our analysis. Mass bias will be corrected by using accepted thallium isotopic ratios, 205Tl/203Tl of 2.3875. In order to develop our method, first, twenty pre-digested samples17 from the top (surface 10 cm) and lower (10cm to 30cm) soil will be analyzed for isotopic compositions of 207Pb/206Pb and 208Pb/206Pb by single-collector Elemental II ICP-MS. These selected samples reflect different years of landuse changes (agriculture, urban and desert). Samples will be diluted to 1:5 solutions to test the intensity of each isotopic peak, and lower dilutions are needed if the intensities are not high enough to tolerant instrumental error. Every three soil solution samples will be analyzed with one NIST 981 sample to check the stability through out the running time. Based on the data of these twenty samples, more samples will be selected from the 200-point sites and analyzed to be representative of the entire Maricopa County. If the isotopic compositions of Pb sources, gasoline, paint, and bedrock, are distinguishable, systematic variations of Pb isotopic compositions of soil samples with changes in landuse types and soil depths are expected. Further, the triple plot of 204Pb/206Pb, 207Pb/206Pb, and 208Pb/206Pb will be needed if the samples are hard to distinguish from this graph, but we may need to measure the 204Pb/206Pb ratio on a multi-collector ICP-MS instead of elemental II. The percentages of every sources at each sampling sites will be calculated, and a three dimensional Pb isotopic profile in the soil of Maricopa County together with  source mixing graph will be constructed. Finally, the total Pb inventories from the soil samples will be estimated and the relationship of these Pb with the past input represented by gasoline and paint will be illustrated.
</p>
<p>

 
Perspective:
</p>
<p>

 
	This isotopic study of Pb in the soil can help us understand the Pb legacy in the environments. The hypothesis of historical sources of Pb will be testified and the amount of Pb in the 2005 soil samples released from the past will be revealed. However, we still don’t know how long these historical Pb would be present in the soil, nor where the rest of the historical lead went during the years. A transport study is further needed to simulate the path of Pb in the environment from the 1970’s to the current state. It is estimated that the major transport route of Pb are advection through dust wind and diffusion with rain fall vertically and horizontally into the soil. Tests can be conducted to measure the sorption property of the background soil, meteorological data can be collected from public sources, simulations can be done with software such as Maple or R, and lastly maps of Pb distributions in the past and future will be able to be constructed.

	The proposed study will be finished during a period from May to August. The money will be used to fund research assistantship in the summer. We have all of the analytical equipment and lab supplies needed for the analytical work.

"321"," N assessment of actual denitrification rates of stormwater retention basin soils","<p>

In Phoenix, the augmentation and redistribution of water generates numerous component ecosystems that are atypical for a desert environment, such as stormwater retention basins. In the Phoenix, AZ metropolitan area, vegetation cover of stormwater retention basins varies from unvegetated xeriscaping to dense grass turf. The selection and maintenance of this design element is likely to have significant ecological ramifications, which in turn will affect the ecosystem services provided by these basins. Prior CAP research has shown that these systems, especially the grassy basins, may be hot spots of N retention or removal in the city because they combine significant N loading with the presence of water, common limiting factors of biogeochemical activity. One mechanism of removal, denitrification, is difficult to measure and is often estimated from a method that measures N2O production when its conversion to N2 is blocked, or is back-calculated from an N budget. Here, I propose to use the 15N isotope to measure direct fluxes of N2 and N2O from 10 xeriscaped and grassy stormwater retention basins. In addition to refining the overall CAP N budget, the use of 15N to trace nitrogen through the system will clarify some of the consequences of basin design on biogeochemical processes that underlie the provision of ecosystem services in stormwater retention basins.

</p>





","
<p>Water and nitrogen (N) are often limiting factors for biogeochemical processes in ecosystems. Over the past century, humans have assumed increased control over both of these resources (Vitousek et al. 1997). Asynchronous timing and differences in spatial distribution of N and water inputs can change the capacity of the system to retain (via biotic uptake and storage in soils) or remove nitrogen (via denitrification or volatilization). Mass balance studies of urban ecosystems suggest that a considerable portion of N is retained or removed within the system. Results from research in urban areas (e.g., Baker et al 2000, Faerge et al. 2001, Boyer et al. 2002, Groffman et al. 2004, Wollheim et al. 2005) have been enigmatic, as unexpectedly high rates of retention and removal have been found despite reduction or elimination of sites and conditions where storage or denitrification is typically thought to occur. Therefore, many researchers are deconstructing the “black-box” city ecosystem, turning their attention to capacity of N retention and removal in component  ecosystems of cities (Groffman et al. 2002, Zhu et al. 2004), and attempting to identify “hot spots,” i.e., locations with especially high processing rates (McClain et al. 2003). This approach can elucidate the principal drivers of elemental transport and transformation in urban landscapes (Kaye et al. 2006).</p>


<p>Some component ecosystems of the urban area are specifically designed for multiple uses (e.g., stormwater retention basins that are also playing fields), but maximizing one service often entails trade-offs with other services (Grimm et al. 2004), which are rarely considered in urban ecosystem design and management. Stormwater retention basins are a common example of designed ecosystems created to provide the ecosystem service of flood mitigation, as urbanization increases the amount of storm runoff (Arnold and Gibbons, 1996), and thus many developed areas have stormwater retention basins designed to receive local drainage. The stormwater runoff entering these basins frequently has high nutrient concentrations. The fate of this added N is unknown. Soils in retention basins may provide the regulating ecosystem service of water purification (nitrate removal from the infiltrating water) and the supporting ecosystem service of nutrient cycling (removal of N from the ecosystem via denitrification).</p>
<p>With the help of previous CAP funding, I have conducted a survey of 32 basins (16 grassy, 16 xeric) and measured denitrification potential as well as general soil characteristics. The results show that grassy basin soils have more organic matter and water (Figure 2). The evidence that basins of both types are not accumulating nitrate (NO3–) when compared to other types of urban soils, coupled with the observation that potential denitrification rates of xeriscaped basins are very low (Figure 3), suggests that the mechanisms responsible for lowered NO3– concentration differ by basin type.</p>


<p>There are three alternate hypotheses explaining the reduced nitrate concentrations in retention basin soils:
</p>

<p>H1: 	Low inorganic soil N is the result of export to recipient systems (ground-water or deeper soil storage).
</p>
<p>H2: 	Low inorganic soil N is the result of incorporation into microbial biomass or plant uptake.
</p>
<p>H3:	Low inorganic soil N is the result of removal via gas loss (denitrification, volatilization, or gas loss during nitrification or incomplete nitrification).</p>

<p>To evaluate these mechanisms, I am conducting more intensive research at 10 basins (5 of each kind) to evaluate possible storage in soil, transmission to groundwater, and loss via denitrification. For assessment of first two, I have assessed changes of nitrate and chloride (Cl-) concentration with depth. This method is similar to one employed by several authors (e.g., Walvoord et al. (2003), Seyfried et al. (2005), and Deans et al. (2005)). Preliminary results from this approach have shown that, at least to 60 cm, there is nitrate consumption with depth in grassy basins, despite the high levels of N entering the system via fertilizer (approximately 7 g m-2 y-1). The xeriscaped basins also have nitrate consumption at depth, but are accumulating nitrate in the uppermost soil layer. </p>

<p>I will be using 15N additions to examine the third hypothesis: gaseous N losses from the retention basins. The use of isotopically labeled NO3– enables simultaneous detection of multiple possible transformations that may be acting concurrently. I propose to conduct a field experiment by applying water with 15NO3¬¬– to plots at both xeriscaped and grassy retention basins in the Phoenix metropolitan area. Following experimental flooding, I will evaluate gas and water losses of N, as well as partitioning into different soil pools over the course of several months. </p>

<p>Ten basins of comparable size, 5 grassy and 5 xeriscaped, will be selected for this experiment. A circular plot of ~30 cm diameter will be established in each of the basins. Soil samples will be taken prior to experimentation to determine background d15N values as described in Knowles and Blackburn (1993), as well as organic matter and moisture content. Zero-tension lysimeters will be installed beneath each plot so that infiltrating water can be sampled after application. Water with 15NO3¬¬–, along with the conservative tracer Br- to track water movement, will be applied to the plot, simulating a rain event in which the basin is flooded. The water will be enriched with 98 atom% 15N as K15NO3¬¬, with an overall concentration of NO3¬¬– comparable to storm runoff. Because the NO3¬¬– concentration is already relatively high in the stormwater entering these systems, it is possible to add trace amounts of 15N without significantly increasing concentration and thus stimulating reaction rates (Knowles and Blackburn 1993).</p>

<p>Immediately after the 15NO3¬¬– addition, gas samples will be taken by placing lids with creating closed chambers. Gas samples will be taken at 0, 0.5, 1, 4, 10, and 24 hours to determine denitrification rates and N2O production from other biogeochemical processes. At 4 and 24 hours, any water leached into the lysimeters will be collected and analyzed for [NO3¬¬–], [NH4+], and 15N/14N ratios for each species, as well as dissolved organic carbon After 24 hours, soil cores will be taken for analysis of partitioning 15N into NO3¬¬– and NH4+, as described in Knowles and Blackburn (1993), and will be analyzed for organic matter and moisture content. Additionally, soil samples will be taken again four times over the next six months to evaluate longer-term fate of the applied 15NO3¬¬–.</p>",NULL
"322","Soil black carbon dynamics in central Arizona","<p>

Black carbon (BC) is considered to be the most refractory component of organic matter in soils and is produced by biomass burning (typically in the form of forest fires) and fossil fuel combustion. BC typically represents a small portion of the soil organic carbon (SOC); however, in certain locations BC can represent more than 30% of the SOC. These “BC hotspot” locations are typically areas characterized by (1) low SOC, (2) intense wildfire activity, and (3) the presence of fossil fuel burning. Central Arizona contains all three factors and is unique because BC can perhaps play a more important role in biogeochemical soil processes relative to areas with low BC concentrations.</p> 
<p>The first phase of this project focuses on BC concentration and how it relates to land use classifications. We hypothesized and confirmed that BC concentrations are higher in soils classified as urban and are lower in soils classified as desert.  We also collected isotopic compositions of BC in soils in an attempt to identify a BC source. BC isotopic composition suggests that BC is a mixture of burned plant material and fossil fuel.</p>
<p>The second phase of this project is to characterize biogeochemical processes that remove BC from the soil system. We characterize two processes that are responsible for BC degradation: photochemical and microbial oxidation. We are interested in molecular characterization of BC before and after these processes. This type of characterization will help us understand the fundamental chemistry of BC. We hypothesize that BC undergoes functional group changes during both photo and microbial oxidation.  We have shown that BC can be photo-oxidized over extended time scales (>1 year). New data has also suggested that BC can be functionalized with carbonyl (carbon-oxygen double bond) groups during photo-oxidation.</p> 


</p>","<p>Black carbon concentration and isotopic composition in soils is measured using a chemo-thermo oxidation method (CTO375) in which a collected soil sample is weighed into a small silver capsules. The sample is then acidified with hydrochloric acid to remove carbonates. Once dry, samples are then placed in an oven at 375oC for 24h to remove labile carbon. The capsules are then closed and analyzed for carbon concentration and isotopic composition using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). All carbon remaining in samples after CTO375 is classified as BC.</p>
<p>Photo-oxidation of BC is carried out under a mercury lamp. Soil samples first undergo CTO375 in bulk to isolate BC. CTO375 treated samples are then placed in home built quartz cuvettes and placed under the lamp for 24 hours. The mercury lamp mimics 50x the insolation per day of natural sunlight in Phoenix, AZ (i.e. samples receive same insolation in 24h under mercury lamp that they would receive in 1200h in natural light). Samples are then analyzed for BC concentration and isotopic composition before and after photo-oxidation as described above.
<p>Molecular characterization has been completed with a variety of methods. These methods include Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR; liquid and solid state), spectrofluorometry, electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). FTIR has proven to be the most useful method showing significant functional group changes before and after photo-oxidation. Functional group changes include molecules made up of mostly hydrocarbon ring and straight chain structures to hydrocarbon (ring and chain) and carbonyl groups, respectively.</p>  
<p>Marie Nahlik, an undergrad at ASU, conducted a sub-project as her Barrett honors thesis under the direction of A. Hamilton and H.E. Hartnett. She hypothesized that BC concentrations in urban soil would negatively correlate with home value and income level of the population living near the sample sites (higher BC concentrations found in lower income populations). She was able to do a high-resolution land use study that included sub-classification of urban sites. These sub-classifications were residential, non-residential, and institutional land use sites. She was able to find differences in BC concentrations between institutional type and the other two land use types (non-residential and residential). We presume this is because of the institutional sites’ proximity to major roads and intersections; however site distance from roads has not been statistically quantified. She was not able to find a positive correlation between BC concentration and home value or income level. However, a more complete survey of sample sites could be done to validate this negative conclusion.</p>",NULL
"324","Ecophysical and behavioral adaptations of birds to rapid urbanization of a desert environment","
<p>

For the past two years, Bobby Fokidis has studied behavioral and physiological adaptations of sedentary Sonoran Desert passerines to urbanization through a multifaceted approach that combines behavioral, endocrine, ecological, and immunological methodologies. This research has resulted in new and exciting insights into how and potentially why native avian species differ in their adaptability to human-modified environments. Among the salient findings:
</p>
<p>

 
	(a) Within species, city birds generally host substantially fewer blood parasites than their desert counterparts. As these parasites may have detrimental effects on their hosts, this difference may confer a fitness advantage to urban residents.
</p>
<p>

 
	(b) The acute physiological response to mild acute stress (capture and restraint for 30 min) differs between city and desert resident congeners. In other species, the stress response can result in beneficial or detrimental health effects (e.g., susceptibility to disease and parasite infection, body condition and fat reserves, behavior), depending on the intensity, duration, and frequency of the stress. The observations lead to the formulation of testable hypotheses regarding the mechanisms that influence the body condition and survival of birds living in urban vs. desert environments.
</p>
<p>

 
	(c) City and desert conspecific birds differ behaviorally in response to a standard simulated territory intrusion. Further research is needed to identify the basis of these differences and their potential ecological and physiological (e.g., on immune function and body condition) consequences.
</p>
<p>

 

As the CAP LTER web site indicates, “Arizona has been the second fastest-growing state for the past six years, with Phoenix as its capital and the largest city in the Southwest. The Phoenix metropolitan area's spectacular growth in population --doubling twice in the past 35 years --and its rapid and continuing expansion into former agricultural and pristine settings provides a unique opportunity to monitor human-induced ecological transformations, resulting from rapid land-use transformations”. 
</p>
<p>

 
As the Phoenix metropolitan area continues to expand in the coming decades, city planners, wildlife managers, and conservationists will increasingly need to anticipate the impact of urbanization resulting, e.g., from the creation of new residential areas encompassing managed city parks and native desert patches, on wildlife. Anticipating this influence can be based only on studies with predictive value, i.e., that allow us to estimate qualitative and quantitative effects of future environmental alterations on current wildlife populations. Addressing this topic in turn requires a detailed understanding of how urbanization affects wildlife which, in turn, necessitates an integrated multidisciplinary approach incorporating not only correlative analyzes, but also manipulative experiments. Research on this subject addresses the effects of human activities on biodiversity and some of its specific components and, therefore, directly pertains to the objectives of the CAP LTER Human Control of Biodiversity IPA.

<p>
Ph.D. student Bobby Fokidis will receive RA support from CAP LTER for the following:
</p>
<p>

  
	a. Bobby will be responsible for field-sampling birds of five resident species (Curvebilled Thrasher, Northern Mockingbird, Abert’s and Canyon Towhees, and House Sparrow) along the Phoenix desert-urban gradient, as done in the past two years. Blood samples collected from sampled birds will be analyzed for their concentrations in reproductive and stress hormone using established and validated assay techniques. Hormone concentrations will be analyzed as a function of time of year and time of day, sex, age, reproductive status, and degree and type of urbanization. Endocrine data will be used to research associations between circulating hormone concentrations and behavior, which will be measured immediately before capture. Blood samples will also be used to prepare thin blood smears that will be analyzed to determine intensity of hemoparasite infection. Parasite infections will be correlated with body condition to test the hypothesis that heavier parasite loads are negatively associated with this condition. Finally, samples will serve to measure aspects of immune function, which will in turn be correlated with body condition and parasite infections.
</p>
<p>

  
	b. The above data, collected in Fall 2008 and Spring 2009, will be appended to similar data obtained in identical conditions in 2006-2008. The resulting multi-year data sets will be analyzed as a function of annual differences in weather parameters, in particular precipitation and temperature. These analyses will lead to the development of models that explain the contribution of short-term climate variation to body condition as a function of the local microenvironment. Urbanization generally results in stabilization of environmental conditions, particularly water and food availability. It is thus predicted that along the desert-urban gradient, weather variables (i.e., annual differences in precipitation and temperature) will play a lesser role in accounting for annual differences in body condition and other parameters as urbanization increases.
</p>

c. Bobby will determine the endocrine responses of the study species sampled in urban and native habitats to a standard short-term physiological challenge. For this, he will measure circulating concentrations of the stress hormone corticosterone immediately after capture and injection of short-acting peptides (adrenocorticotropic hormone; corticotropin-releasing hormones, arginine vasotocin) that are known from other studies to acutely stimulate the secretion of corticosterone. Absence of difference in the effects of this challenge between desert and urban conspecific birds will suggest that the above-described physiological differences (acute response to capture and handling stress) between urban and desert birds are phenotypic and the study species, therefore, exhibit a high degree of physiological and behavioral plasticity. Alternately, differences in response to a same challenge between urban and desert birds will suggest lack of plasticity that may result either from irreversible (= “organizational”) effects of specific environmental factors during early life (i.e., pre-or early post-hatching) or, less likely, from rapid (within a few generations given the recent history of the Phoenix metropolitan area) genetic differentiation resulting in urban and conspecific desert birds differing genetically.

"325","Incorporating ecology into stormwater management solutions","<p>
Urbanization modifies hydrologic processes and contributes to contaminant loads in stormwater runoff. These relationships are well established and have been documented by numerous studies. However, most studies relate stormwater runoff volume and water quality to bulk measures of urbanization such as broad land-use categories (e.g., urban/undeveloped) or percent impervious cover (Dougherty et al. 2006). These bulk measures do not adequately reflect the complex structure of urban catchments that may influence stormwater runoff (Groffman et al. 2004, Carle et al. 2005, Walsh et al. 2005). Further, most stormwater studies have addressed conditions in the more mesic eastern United States (and other countries) that may differ from the unique monsoon storms of the arid Southwest. Thus, complex dynamics among catchment characteristics, storm attributes, and runoff in highly urbanized settings of the Southwest are poorly understood. A better understanding of the complex relationships between urban development patterns and stormwater runoff that are specific to the arid Southwest is essential to meet these challenges and to manage stormwater runoff effectively.

A working group on urban stormwater formed in fall 2007. The group identified several questions worthy of pursuit, many of which are already being addressed in separate studies. For this request, we focus on three questions that can be tacked with a summer–academic year RA combination. The intent is to gather sufficient preliminary data to justify a proposal submission to the NSF or other funding agencies by fall 2008.
</p>
<p>

 
-How does landscape configuration (both the hydrologic flowpaths and the nature of the patches they cross/intercept) influence the ability of a watershed to retain, transform, or convey materials?
</p>
<p>


-How effective are different Best Management Practices (BMPs) at reducing nutrient, sediment, organic, or metal loads to recipient systems?
</p>
<p>

 
+What are the relevant recipient systems?
</p>
<p>

 
+How does solute transport vary across scales between natural and altered lands? How do hydrology and the processes of retention, transformation, and transport scale within the nested hierarchical structure of an urban watershed? Are scaling rules the same as in desert systems?
</p>
<p>

 
+Can urban riparian “restoration” projects be combined with stormwater BMPs to create designed ecosystems that provide services of water, nutrient, and sediment retention while also providing aesthetic and recreational services and enhancing biodiversity?
</p>
<p>

 

Specific duties of the RA:
</p>
<p>

 
Data acquisition component: Hale will work with Earl and Grimm to develop partnerships with FCDMC, Tempe, and Scottsdale, all of whom have programs for sampling stormwater. She will develop a database that incorporates storm hydrology and water quality data, and merge it with an existing CAP database developed by post-doc David Lewis that describes storm loads from 15 individual catchments across up to 52 individual storm events (Lewis and Grimm 2007). Building this database will allow extensive exploration of the relationship between catchment features and stormwater transport.
</p>
<p>

  
The RA also will acquire and process remote imagery that can give a much more detailed picture of catchment characteristics and likely flowpaths. For this, she will work with Arrowsmith and Toke to develop a means to characterize these urban flowpaths, by identifying features such as grassy swales and retention structures, impervious surfaces, and extant washes. This mapping will require imagery that can reveal microtopography (such as LIDAR), and also municipal data on infrastructure design and location.
</p>
<p>

 
Modeling component: Working with Lin Ye, the RA will help to quantify parameters needed to model stormwater transport and retention along urban flowpaths. Most of these paramters will be available from the mapping component, above, but will also require some determination of retention characteristics of different urban patch types.
</p>
<p>

 
Field component: During spring 2008, Hale will work with Grimm, Earl, Hartnett, Toke, and Arrowsmith to design a plan for nested-scale sampling of stormwater runoff, probably in Indian Bend Wash watershed. As this will form part of her dissertation research, she is able to work on this project (and is currently funding by a SFAZ fellowship). We propose to begin sampling the nested catchment during the monsoon season of summer 2008, using the winter-spring period to design and test various stormwater capturing devices and to ascertain the success of our recently installed automatic sampler on the Indian Bend Wash.

"326","Quantitative modeling of plant species counts for efficient prediction","
<p>

There has recently been an increasing interest in `zero-inflated' (ZI) regression models to account for `excess' zeros in data.  A very good example is the extensive CAP LTER survey 200 plant count data.  Here each of the plant species are absent in many of the survey plots – thus giving rise to the excess zeros in the model. Again, some plants species are positively correlated among themselves, which means that they either co-occur more frequently than they would if they were not associated. Also, some times some plant species are negatively correlated, which means that they usually do not occur together. The nature of these correlations, the excess zeros, and the vast data over a heterogeneous landuse is difficult to model as well as to predict. We approach this problem with a statistical ``multivariate zero-inflated” model using information from landuse, elevation, income etc other variables that help to inform about the plant preferences as well as plant counts in these plots. The available data helps us to build a rich model as well as to compare the predictions with actual data to assess model fit.

"327","Chlorophyll florescence","<p>

Urban trees contribute significantly to improving human health and comfort and urban sustainability by moderating urban heat island effects,  improving energy conservation, increasing carbon storage, removing air pollutants, providing wildlife habitat and increasing aesthetics and property values (Dwyer, et al., 2003). Rapid screening techniques to assess tree fitness and productivity are essential to identifying changes within the urban forest productivity as well as providing a foundation for improving resource management practices (McPherson 1993).
</p> 






","  <p>
    1. Develop a protocol for rapid screening of chlorophyll fluorescence of urban trees.
  </p>
  <p>
    
Protocols for leaf chlorophyll fluorescence have been developed and tested for agricultural crops (Carrasco-Rodeiguez &amp; Valle-Tascon, 2001), little research has been done to modify this screening protocol for use on tree canopies. I will develop a rapid screening protocol for assessing tree canopy chlorophyll fluorescence by modifying protocols set forth by Percival (2005) on Quercus sp.  Rapid screening of chlorophyll fluorescence as a measure of ecosystem carbon saturation was proposed as a regular monitoring activity across all LTER network sites at the September 2006 LTER All Scientist meeting in Estes Park, CO (http://intranet.lternet.edu/modules.php?name=UpDownload&amp;req=viewsdownload&amp;sid=22).In the future, this rapid screening protocol for chlorophyll fluorescence will be useful in training LTER network technicians in the future collection of urban tree fitness data as a part of on-going monitoring projects across the LTER network.
  </p>
  <p>
    
 

2. Conduct field research doing rapid screening of chlorophyll fluorescence of urban trees in the Phoenix urban ecosystem.
  </p>
  <p>
    
  
The rapid screening protocol will be used to assess mid-day of canopy chlorophyll fluorescence of trees at the NDV experimental site.  A sub-set of NDV trees, specifically those that were intensively studied for diurnal patterns of net gas exchange (Martin and Busse, 2008), will be selected for investigations diurnal patterns of  tree chlorophyll fluorescence and linkages to net canopy gas exchange, and microclimate and surface energy exchange. There are many advantages to using the NDV experimental site for this research. For example, the NDV research site consists of five landscape design treatments that create different microclimates for tree exposure (Busse and Martin, 2008), and a continuous stream of microclimate data are collected at the NDV treatments (Martin, 2008).
  </p>
  <p>
    
 

B. Research Plan
  </p>
  <p>
    

Work on the project goal 1, development of a rapid screening protocol of tree chlorophyll fluorescence, will begin during late spring 2008.  Project goal 2, fluorescence screening measurements of NDV trees will be undertaken during the June and July of 2008. Data analysis and integration with CAP LTER data sets as well as preparation of manuscripts for publication will occur during fall/winter 2008-09.
  </p>
  <p>
    
    

C. Significance and Benefits
  </p>
  <p>
    

Data from this project will be archived within the CAP LTER NDV database. I anticipate that the project will result in the publication of at least one research publications in internationally recognized journals. Preliminary results will also be used to apply for future grant funding. Research results will also have practical applications and will be presented at disciplinary science society conferences.  In addition to benefiting CAP LTER research programs; this project will also benefit a greater understanding of the basic biology that supports best management practices of urban landscape ecology and sustainability.

"328","Simulated temperature variability among PASS neighborhoods and its interrelation with SES and PASS survey results","<p>
The purpose of this project is the analysis of hazardous heat exposure in PASS neighborhoods and its relationship with neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and results from the 2006 PASS survey. PASS obtained information on resident weather-related experiences and perceptions during the summer of 2005 in 40 diverse neighborhoods in the metropolitan region. PASS neighborhood hourly air temperatures for selected weather conditions in 2005 will be provided by simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). The analysis focuses mainly on a heat wave period (16-19 July 2005) that was selected following criteria used by Meehl and Tebaldi (2004).
</p> 




","<p>WRF results will be integrated with US Census block group (neighborhood) sociodemographic data using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to compare spatially variable simulated temperatures with SES characteristics in the PASS neighborhoods. These data will be analyzed further by examining the spatial pattern of local risk perception for these 40 neighborhoods in relation to temperature simulations, which will indicate the relationship between perceived and scientifically measured heat stress. The role of SES in forming perceptions and experiences will also be analyzed. Measures of heat exposure are minimum and maximum temperatures and duration of exposure to hazardous temperatures for the neighborhoods. These analyses will demonstrate whether low income and minority census tracts are exposed to earlier onsets and duration of high temperatures.</p>
 
<p>In previous CAP LTER research, neighborhood microclimatic conditions as detected by means of remote sensing and weather stations were overlayed with SES residential segregation patterns. The results showed that land use characteristics directly affect landscape microclimates and amplitude of extreme heat events at a neighborhood scale and highly correlate with household income (Jenerette et al. 2007; Stabler 2005; Stefanov et al. 2004). Monitored air temperatures in 8 neighborhoods used in a simulation model of human thermal comfort showed significantly higher chronic exposure to outdoor heat stress and fewer coping resources in low-income neighborhoods (Harlan et al. 2006).</p>
 
<p>The advantage of using a well-tested regional weather model (Grossman-Clarke et al. 2005, 2008) is the continuous availability of air temperature in space and time for any period of interest. Based on the method developed by Stefanov et al. (2001) A. Buyantuyev recently derived Phoenix 2005 land use data that are available for use in WRF in this study. Grossman-Clarke et al. (2005 &amp; 2008) integrated urban land use and physical processes to the Mesoscale Meteorological Model (MM5) and its successor WRF to enable simulations of the influence of urbanization on weather in Phoenix. Model changes improved significantly the capability to simulate the diurnal temperature cycle in the Phoenix metropolitan region, enabled the simulation of the urban heat island effect and to capture the spatial heterogeneity in simulated air temperatures across neighborhoods in the metropolitan region.</p> 

<p>This work will benefit the research related to PASS as outlined in this proposal but also the “Climate and Ecosystem Responses” IPA. It is a step towards the investigation of historical and present relationships among land use and land cover, microclimates, and SES residential segregation.</p>",NULL
"329","Development of numerical methods and statistical approaches for interpretation of ESI Mass Spectrometry: Advancing molecular-level characterization of organic C in urban ecosystems","<p>
Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a significant component in aquatic carbon budgets and its fate has implications for carbon biogeochemistry, and ultimately for ecosystem functioning. We have been examining DOC composition at the molecular-level in the Verde River and in Tempe Town Lake using liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (LC ESI-MS). This exciting technique examines the extremely complex mixture of polar organic compounds in water provides both a broad picture or ‘fingerprint’ of the compounds present and specific-compound identification. This technique provides a new understanding of DOC sources and fate in the urban systems because it allows us to examine not only the amount of carbon present but also the composition of the carbon. This molecular-level analysis of the range of compound types that can be extracted from soils and transformed in aquatic will provide new insights that begin to unlock the ‘black box’ of DOC composition. The ESI-MS system generates very large datasets - individual water samples produce spectra with 1000’s of peaks. The assessment of both large- and small-scale difference among spectra is key to understanding the processes transforming carbon in the environment. This request for summer salary support will allow me to spend the time required to develop techniques for assessing these large and complex datasets. This work is relevant to Fluxes of Materials and Socio-Ecosystem Response IPA, the project-wide 200-Point Survey, as well as the general research area of Biogeochemical Processes.
</p> 





","
  <p>
    Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a complex mixture of molecules from many different organic compound classes including: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and anthropogenic compounds (1) with a correspondingly wide range of terrestrial, aquatic and anthropogenic sources (2-4). Dissolved organic carbon has a variety of ecosystem effects and a full understanding of its reactivity requires knowing the composition of the complex organic mixture. My research group is developing state-of-the-art mass spectrometry techniques for examining polar organic compounds in water and soils using liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. This technique is beginning to reveal the detailed chemical composition of dissolved organic carbon. This composition is very complex (see Fig. 1, attached); the number and abundance of compounds present in just a single water sample presents significant data analysis, interpretation, and management challenges(5). This proposal requests funds for H. Hartnett to develop numerical and statistical approaches to aid in data interpretation that will advance the utility of this new method of molecular-level carbon characterization.

Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS)
  </p>
  <p>
    
  
ESI MS allows the molecular-level analysis of polar organic compounds in water. This is important as the labile fraction of DOC is generally water soluble and by definition polar; and yet many organic analyses are specific for non-polar compounds(1, 6). ESI-MS allows direct analysis of polar organic molecules (30-1500 atomic mass units, amu) in water (&lt;1 ml) with sub-micromolar (0.1-0.5µM) level sensitivity (7).The spectra generated provide the molecular weight distribution of the compounds present; a measure of compound abundance; chemical characterization via chromatographic separation, as well as positive and negative ion detection; and specific compound identification when coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (8). This technique has been applied in rain water (9, 10) and stream water (11), ground water (12), and for riverine humic and fulvic acids (13, 14).

Progress on prior summer

 funding 
We have been characterizing DOC in samples collected seasonally from Tempe Town Lake (Fig. 2) and the Verde River since January 2005. DOC concentrations in Tempe Town Lake vary both seasonally and inter-annually. The amount of carbon in the lake appears to increase during rainy seasons (especially monsoons (orange), but also note the winter high-flow event of Jan05) and decrease during evaporative periods. The overall pattern in DOC with time allows inferences about the biogeochemical and/or physical processes that transform DOC (microbial attack, sorption to surfaces, etc). We monitor bulk carbon analyses but ultimately, this only reveals how much carbon was lost or gained. To understand which components of the DOC are reactive in the environment and which have the potential to impact ecosystems we must examine the molecular-level composition of the DOC.
  </p>
  <p>
    
   
The complexity of the ESI-MS spectra is both a boon and a curse! Individual compound-level information can reveal a wealth of information, but it is possible to lose sight of the bigger patterns. There is also information to be gained in understanding the patterns present in the ESI spectra. Seasonal changes in the overall distribution of peaks are clearly present (Fig. 1); but it is difficult to describe the trends and patterns without quantitative numerical and statistical analyses. Changes in the number of compounds present from season to season are quite informative and provide evidence that the sources of organic matter to the lake change throughout the year (Fig. 3). We are now poised to assess how the spectral patterns change seasonally, interannually and in response to specific events (i.e., high-river flow vs. evaporative periods or pre/post initial monsoon rain). The relationships among abundant compounds, frequently occurring compounds, unique compounds, etc. are myriad and may provide information about biogeochemical processes. For instance seasonal trends in the ESI MS spectra are not easily amenable to regression analysis given the 1500 or so peaks present in each spectrum. Researchers using high-resolution FTIR- ESI MS have been applying numerical approaches including (but by no means limited to) principal components analysis, cluster analysis and spectral techniques to understand patterns in the abundance and distribution of organic compounds in the environment (15, 16). If funded, this proposal will provide summer salary for Hartnett to start developing some of these techniques for application to the ESI MS data. Hartnett will utilize the wealth of statistical and numerical knowledge available at ASU both through collaboration with other LTER scientists and through the department of statistics; a new faculty colleague in SESE (Timmes) with expertise in numerical methods has also expressed interest in discussing how to implement these approaches.

This proposed research is part of the long-term modeling project of CAPLTER.  Since 1997, my students and I have developed a series of models to simulate land use and land cover change, urban growth, and ecosystem processes in the Phoenix metropolitan area.  All these models have provided us with useful insights into urbanization and its ecological consequences, but are not adequate to address the overarching questions of urban sustainability that involve environmental, economic, and social processes simultaneously.

Thus, this proposed research to move our current modeling activities to a new level of interdisciplinarity – to review a suite of existing sustainability models, and identify a few that are appropriate for simulating the urban sustainability of the Phoenix metropolitan region.  Then these models will be modified as necessary and re-parameterized for addressing urban sustainability-related questions through scenario analysis.  

In addition, I will spend a considerable amount of time throughout the summer to work with my graduate students on research projects and writings directly related to CAPLTER: Alex Buyantuyev on the spatiotemporal analysis of urbanization effects on ecosystem processes; Jen Litteral on effects of urbanization on avian biodiversity in Phoenix; and Kaesha Neil on effects of urbanization on plant flowering phenology.

"331","The socioecology of residential landscapes in the CAP LTER","
<p>
This summer, 2008, I will be conducting research with Dr. Kelli Larson and IGERT graduate fellow Elizabeth Cook to explore the socio-ecology of residential landscapes in the CAP-LTER. Using data from social surveys, homeowner interviews, and extensive ecological sampling in the field, we are asking the following questions: What are the factors that drive residential landscape management decisions, and how do these practices affect ecological processes across a range of scales? After completing a social survey (winter, 2008) and extensive field work to determine yard structure (spring, 2008), this summer we will launch an intensive field campaign to measure ecological processes that capture the heterogeneity of social and structural characteristics of residential yards. Our work will result in several products, including a synthesis of the literature on residential landscape ecology (ESA poster and manuscript led by graduate student E. Cook), a manuscript to Ecology and Society on our primary findings (led by S. Hall or K. Larson), a cotaught IGERT/SOS workshop (Hall and Larson, Fall, 2008), and a new proposal to NSF-CNH, Dynamics of Coupled Human and Natural Systems (to be submitted November, 2008).

<p>
Human management of agricultural lands is the primary driver of global-scale changes to the nitrogen cycle, and second only to fossil fuel combustion in controlling anthropogenic carbon flux to the atmosphere (Vitousek et al. 1997). For example, management practices associated with fertilization and irrigation are known to control large-scale losses of nitrogen to the atmosphere and downstream ecosystems, and tilling is associated with rapid oxidation of soil organic matter to carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas. Although a relatively small area globally, intensively managed urban landscapes such as lawns are increasingly prevalent worldwide. For example, turfgrass is now the largest irrigated crop in the U.S. (Milesi et al. 2005), covering 10-16 million hectares and contributing to high rates of water and fertilizer use. Despite the growing importance of these designed landscapes and potential policy implications, little is known about how diverse homeowner practices impact nutrient cycling and losses at local to regional scales. Furthermore, few studies have used an integrated socioecological design to explicitly link the social drivers of residential land management to ecological impacts. 
</p>
<p>

 
In this research, I am working closely with Dr. Kelli Larson, a social scientist, to ask, What are the factors that drive residential landscape management decisions, and how do these practices affect ecological processes? We hypothesize that water and agrichemical product use will correlate with both social structural characteristics as well as beliefs and perceived norms. Furthermore, we expect heterogeneity within ‘landscape types’ such as lawns to be large and driven primarily by management practices for variables associated with nitrogen (e.g. N2O emissions, nitrate concentrations) and by plant species for variables associated with carbon (e.g. soil organic matter, respiration). We will test these hypotheses in four neighborhoods in the Phoenix metropolitan that are co-located with other comprehensive field work at CAP. These neighborhoods range from low-to-high income households, predominantly mesic to xeric yards, and are located in the urban core and on the city fringe.
</p>
<p>

  
Our research has begun with a social survey conducted by Dr. Larson that targeted random sample of 400 homeowners across these four distinct neighborhoods (to be completed March 2008). This survey used a modified value-belief-norm model to determine the theoretical drivers of behaviors in addition to landscape management practices. This spring, with a nested sampling approach, we plan to quantify yard structure in all survey households (non-respondents and respondents, n = 400) and measure select ecological variables in the yards of all respondents (n=120). Within all respondent sites, we will measure variables that characterize biological structure (plant community composition, distribution, biovolume) and key soil properties that drive nutrient cycling (temperature, moisture, total organic matter). This summer, we will follow up this extensive survey with intensive social and ecological sampling within a subset of sites (n=32), representing 8 yards per neighborhood split between mesic lawns and xeric vegetation that represent diverse management practices. At the intensive sites, we will also analyze soil microbial processes (net N mineralization, nitrification), soil emissions of greenhouse gases (methane, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide) and gases that regulate air quality (ammonia, nitric oxide). Our intensive ecological sampling will be accompanied by semi-structured interviews to explore questions raised by past research about how residential landscapes reflect social identities and status (e.g., “ecology of prestige;” (Grove et al. 2006)), why environmental concern does not translate into pro-ecological behavior (Robbins et al. 2001), and how neighborhood norms influence landscaping behavior (Nielson and Smith 2005).

Research completed to date (primarily by undergraduate research fellows working within the Center for Environmental Economics and Sustainability Policy CEESP)) has lead to the development of a data base with records for the sales of private homes in Maricopa County over the period from 1995 to 2006. These data include links to several local amenities including the concentration of air pollutants and temperature records for the months preceding the homes’ sales. They do not include information on patterns of land uses in areas surrounding each house location.
</p>
<p>

 

This proposal for research support would provide resources for one undergraduate to work with me to expand the geo-coded data for Maricopa County to include a historical record of the land uses relevant to the properties based on their sale dates as well as to begin the process of developing a comparable data base for Pinal County, Arizona.
</p>
<p>

 

The data development described as part of this proposal is a component of a larger research program. It will support the economic modeling and econometric estimation undertaken to meet three objectives:
</p>
<p>

 

1.	to develop hedonic property value models describing the relationship between housing sale prices and the structural and locational characteristics of these homes; the hedonic framework allows the estimation of the incremental contribution of non-market site attributes such as air quality or the land use patterns in areas adjoining private homes (i.e. open space) to housing prices (see Freeman[2003], Smith et.al [ 2002] and Mc Connell and  Walls [2005]).
</p>
<p>

  

2.	to link the records on actual housing sales including home and land attributes as well as the measures of the incremental economic values of amenities from objective (1) to the attitudinal and socio-economic information developed as part of the 2006 PASS survey with the objective of examining the consistency of economic measures of the incremental benefits of these policies and attitudes of Phoenix area households, after controlling for their demographic and economic characteristics.
</p>
<p>

 

3.	to develop a structural economic model of the locational choices of households within the Phoenix metropolitan area. This framework seeks to assess the implications of large scale land use policies on the patterns of household location, housing prices, and the general equilibrium benefits associated with these policies. This approach does not have the detailed structure generally associated with the Urban Sim model. It is more parsimonious in it characterization of land use decisions but allows for consistent measurement of economic benefits of large policy changes. Smith et al [2004] have used this type of structure to evaluate the effects of  air quality changes in Southern California. Hallstrom and Smith [2003] have extended the framework to consider land use changes and report a preliminary assessment of the Multiple Species Conservation Program for San Diego County California. The proposed research would seek to extend this effort for the Phoenix metropolitan area.

"333","Avian Adaptations to Urbanization","
<p>Our current work investigates Sonoran Desert songbirds, particularly those inhabiting the Phoenix metropolitan area, as experimental models to better understand how wildlife adapts to urbanization and the mechanisms that underlie this adaptation. We use an integrated eco-physiological and behavioral approach and are particularly interested in the effects of urbanization on the reproductive physiology and behavior of native birds, as well as in identifying factors that mediate these effects. In preparation for breeding, seasonally breeding urban birds often recrudesce their reproductive system earlier and faster than corresponding rural birds. As a consequence, urban birds may have a longer annual breeding season and, therefore, a higher annual and lifetime breeding success than rural birds. Food availability plays a critical role in shaping life history transitions and reproductive cycles: most seasonally breeding organisms have evolved responses to environmental factors such that they reproduce when food resources needed to successfully raise their offspring are seasonally most abundant. Given this evidence, we hypothesize that differences in food availability between urban and rural environments is critical to controlling the above differences in reproductive development and phenology. This hypothesis is being tested by combining correlative field studies with investigations (e.g., “common garden” experiments) in which urban and rural native birds are brought into captivity and then exposed to strictly identical and controlled conditions. This general approach has the potential to improve our understanding of phenotypic plasticity and have ramifications for questions related to the development and management of urban spaces that designed to be used and shared by humans and wildlife.

Tempe Town Lake (a man-made lake in downtown Tempe, AZ) is primarily a recreational body of water, but the lake also serves as a form of flood control. Rainwater and stormwater flow into the lake during the summer monsoons and winter storms; that water carries organic carbon into the lake. The amount of carbon can vary quite a lot over the year. In Jan 2005 a winter storm brought river water with high dissolved organic carbon concentrations. Carbon in the lake decreased over the spring/early summer but increased again after the monsoon rains. These results suggest that during rainy seasons, organic carbon from the land is washed into Tempe Town Lake. During dry periods, biogeochemical processes consume organic carbon and decrease DOC concentrations in the lake. The goal of this project is to collect daily water samples from Tempe Town Lake over the course of the summer and analyze the amount and the form of the organic compounds in the lake before, during and after monsoon rain events.
</p> 
","<p>
Potential questions to be explored:
</p>
<p>


•How many and what type of organic compounds are carried into the lake by monsoon rain events?
</p>
<p>


•Is that carbon removed by biological processes? And how rapidly?

"335","Riparian Carbon and Nitrogen Cycling: Influences of Spatial Heterogeneity and Hydrologic Vectors","
<p>
Terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem ecologists study the same phenomena (e.g., nutrient cycling, energy flow, succession) but they do so within separate conceptual frameworks. Terrestrial frameworks address state factors of climate, organisms, parent material, topography, and time to understand ecosystem processes within a location, but less often consider how ecosystems are connected. Aquatic ecologists, especially those studying flowing waters, emphasize the role of water as a means of propagating processes and materials through space and time. Both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems contain hydrologic vectors as well as soils or sediments that record the influences of state factors. This dissertation is an investigation of carbon and nitrogen cycling in the stream-riparian corridor of the San Pedro River, a large desert river, and tests the relative effects of soil characteristics and hydrologic vectors. Riparian zones are well suited to such investigations because they are spatially heterogeneous and subject to material and water inputs from multiple hydrologic vectors. Spatially explicit methods showed that flood vectors homogenized soil characteristics and denitrification along a stream reach with frequent overbank floods, whereas soils of a riparian site that was infrequently inundated by floods were heterogeneous. Legacies of previous floods appeared to determine the spatial locations of denitrification at the latter site. At a plot scale, manipulation of precipitation and flood vectors across a gradient of soil types showed that water functioned as an essential resource during the dry season, resulting in increased emissions of trace gases following simulation of floods. Following inundation of riparian soils by several monsoon floods, however, further addition of water appeared to suppress biogeochemical activity by decreasing oxygen availability. Thus desert riparian ecosystems appear to shift seasonally along a terrestrial-aquatic continuum, functioning similarly to terrestrial ecosystems during dry seasons, but like wetlands following inundation by floods. Finally, analyses encompassing several years of observations revealed strong correlations between regimes of hydrology and resource availability. Overall, this study demonstrates that the hydrologic regime drives spatial and temporal patterns in biogeochemical processes, but that soil characteristics may modify the duration and magnitude of biological responses to hydrologic vectors in desert riparian ecosystems..

"340","Estimating future water supply from the highly-managed Salt and Verde River Systems","
<p>
In the coming year, we extend our model to include the components necessary for simulating the volume of water held in the system of reservoirs. Runoff from our present model serves as the sole input to the reservoirs, while the outputs contained in the new model will be simulated evaporation from the reservoir and user-defined releases of water.  Basically, we simulate volume in the reservoir system as opposed to climatically-driven variations in runoff.  The volume of the reservoir system reflects decisions made by water managers, and the new model will allow management strategies to be prescribed and the impact on volume will be determined.  Among other outcomes, one would be able to simulate how management decisions impact potential extreme events in the future.  For example, the decision to keep the reservoirs at capacity could yield a significant flood event some future wet year; oppositely, the decision to maintain a relatively high level of runoff could exacerbate the effects of future droughts.  

The additions to our model will allow human decision-making to be included in the calculation of the amount of water that can be delivered to Phoenix in any given month.  The addition will allow any number of futuristic climate scenarios to be explored, and users of our model could witness the effect of various management strategies on the amount of water that can be delivered over a selected period of time.

Understanding the creation, distribution, and reception of environmental education programs is critical to comprehending the roles of equity, community engagement, stewardship and policy in urban systems.  Education about water is designed to serve several purposes; most directly, it can increase the likelihood that individuals conserve water, and can establish information pathways for rapid information dissemination in times of crisis. But water education can also contribute to citizen participation in policy decisions, interest in seeking information, and can alter human perceptions of local ecosystems.  For education to meet these goals, it has to reach and be accessible to audiences. We will consider water education messages and methods and public reception to understand what influences the equity and effectiveness of public education efforts on water.  This research examines the roles interorganizational interactions play in shaping public understanding of water through education provided to residents of metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona.

We are proposing to integrate data resources between the Decision Center for a Desert City (DCDC) and the Arizona Hydrologic Information System (AHIS). DCDC is producing a wealth of very relevant data for the hydrologic community, focused on sustainability of urban water supplies in the context of climate change.  However, neither the raw data they are accessing for their analyses nor their research results are currently available to the greater research community or to decision makers. AHIS is developing statewide data infrastructure connecting the three universities and providing greatly enhanced access to water related information.  AHIS is also focusing on improving data curation techniques and data search success. It is clear that a collaboration between the two projects would be beneficial for both and therefore, we are proposing DCDC invest in appropriate documentation of the datasets that they are generating in order to maximize its utility for research and decision making. AHIS will provide structured, secure access to the data through search capabilities over time.

"344","Past patterns and future implications of changes in runoff/precipitation ratios on the Salt and Verde Watersheds","
<p>
A key question that we will answer relates to the effectiveness of snowfall relative to rainfall at increasing the ratio on a seasonal basis. During years of high snowfall, the ratio should be low in winter and high in spring. But, when removing the seasonal variability by calculating the ratio value for the winter and spring seasons together as one, is the ratio significantly higher during years when a large fraction of the seasonal precipitation is in the form of snow? The answer has important implications for assessing future water supply in the face of rising temperatures and presumably less snowfall. We will also investigate intra-annual patterns to determine if the runoff/precipitation ratio in winter and spring varies with hydroclimatic conditions in summer, fall, and early winter. From a climate change perspective, this will help us further resolve the importance of changes in summer and fall temperature and precipitation to changes in critical winter and spring runoff.

We will next attempt to separate the climate signal in the time series of the runoff/precipitation ratio from all other controllers (e.g., ground water pumping (lowers ratio), wildfire occurrence (increases ratio), bark beetle outbreaks (increases ratio)). If this is possible we will then investigate the trends and variability in the climate and non-climate controllers.

Finally, we will combine the findings of this work with the results of our climate change-water supply work, which assumed that the runoff/precipitation ratio in the future will remain at historical (1895-present) values. Should the ratio change in the future in response to land surface changes or to increased municipal demand for ground water, our projections of water supply under future climate conditions would have to be modified.

This request is for continuation funding for vulnerability team work started in 2007. Analyses of these data are currently under way with a goal of using climate change scenarios, projected changes in CAP and SRP water availability, coupled with growth projections to identify municipalities and providers that will be most affected by increased demands and reduced supplies due to water portfolios. What is missing from this vulnerability data base are data from agriculture/irrigation districts.  Developing a detailed understanding of agricultural water use, sources, and trends is an important addition to our ongoing work in vulnerability assessment.  Whether agricultural water can work as a buffer against shortages, for whom, and where, is a critical question that would be addressed with the combined and expanded data base.
  
Our goal is to work to integrate the water vulnerability assessment described above with two LTER research streams: one is to link the DCDC vulnerability data with water and hazard related PASS analysis currently being undertaken by Larson et al. (paper in progress);  the second is to integrate our water vulnerability mapping work with an environmental hazard spatial analysis currently underway for CAP-LTER.  Integrating and mapping water resource vulnerabilities in relationship to a broad set of other environmental hazards (floodplains, subsidence zones, industrial hazards, lead pollution etc.) would provide sociospatial data for an ‘all hazards’ analysis of the metro region.

<p>
Over the past four years, researchers at the Decision Center for a Desert City (DCDC) have undertaken path-breaking research on the dynamic linkages between social perceptions and attitudes, environmental and climatic conditions, institutional strategies, sources of water supply, and changing demand for water in Phoenix. We now know, for example, 1) how different vegetation covers and open water bodies contribute to water demand (Guhathakurta and Gober 2007; Brazel et al. in review); 2) the relationships between growth, housing construction, and heat islands (Brazel et al. 2007); 3) the socioeconomic characteristics and locations of populations affected by water stress (Bolin and Larson); and 4) tradeoffs people make between indoor and outdoor water use (Ledlow and Sadalla). Given the expansion of knowledge about the drivers of household water demand and how they are changing, we are now in a position to develop future scenarios of water use. These scenarios would require integration of parameters derived from the various research findings mentioned above into a simulation model. By developing such a simulation model and testing its characteristics, we can explore critical thresholds, non-linearities, sensitivities, and vulnerabilities in our water futures. Also, significantly, it will vastly expand the capabilities of the WaterSim model by fine-tuning its water demand simulations.

Since then, the project has expanded our research aims to include: (1) a comparison of the general public’s and CAP LTER scientists’ understandings of local environmental problems; and (2) a comparison of attitudes of the general public and CAP LTER scientists toward the effectiveness of contrasting policy solutions to these problems. The focus areas of immediate concern, which are also those embedded in PASS 2006, are water shortages, land consumption by urban sprawl, the spread of the urban heat island, and air pollution. Understanding/knowledge is measured by respondents’ ratings of statements that are designed to elicit perceived relative importance of natural forces, socioeconomic drivers, and individual responsibility as causes of environmental problems. Attitudes toward solutions are measured by respondents’ ratings of statements that elicit factors reflecting support or opposition to regulation, taxes and fees, price incentives, technological fixes, and public education approaches to environmental problem-solving. All in all, this study will reveal the extent and character of differences in public and scientific understandings of environmental problems and remedies, and will establish a baseline for measuring change over time.

In either scenario (2 RAs or 1 MA technician and an RA), Dr. Soe Myint will directly supervise the land classification work, and Drs. Turner and Franklin will assist in regard to direction and products, and coordination with other CAP research efforts.

Land Architecture (LA).  LA refers to the kind, magnitude, and spatial pattern of land use and cover.  Different LAs have different implications for environmental (ecosystem) services and human livelihoods.  To date, minimal attention has been given to these architectures as they are? related to climate change and sustainability, although the Global Land Project (IGBP-IHDP) has begun to realize how important LA is to a variety of its synthesis projects, including those on vulnerability and resilience of land systems. Getting LAs “right” is important for the sustainability of the Desert City, recognizing that “right” involves optimizing different sets of services and human outcomes.  In addition, there are important scalar implications for LAs; those providing the best or most desired outcomes at the local level (neighborhood), for example, need not provide the same for the meso level (Sun Valley).  

A program of study on LA will profit the CAP and, we suspect, spread to all other LTERs.  Such a study will involve multiple units and on-going research at CAP, and thus will require substantial planning to coordinate.  However, the land monitoring effort above is foundation, and the proposed project will serve as a springboard for the development of the activity. (Note that Turner has submitted an NSF-CNH on LA in southern Yucatán which, if funded, may be used as template for CAP activities of this kind.)  It is noteworthy that a potential CAP activity will attempt to link ecosystem, watershed, neighborhood, town-city-county research underway, and thus draws upon and would provide outputs for environmental and human subsystem research underway in CAP."
"366","Herpetofauna responses to urban rehabilitation of riparian habitat","<p>Floodplains and riparian areas are some of the most diverse terrestrial habitats on Earth (Naiman et al. 1993). Metropolitan areas can impact these critical riparian habitats through fragmentation (Dynesius and Nilsson 1994; Andersson et al. 2000), altering hydrologic regimes (Larson et al. 2005), and by introducing non-native species (Nilsson and Berggren 2000). Efforts to reverse these negative impacts have resulted in a growing interest to restore or rehabilitate urban riparian areas. For example, within the greater Phoenix metropolitan area, some projects have rehabilitated wetlands by waste-water treatment facilities, whereas other projects have restored native riparian vegetation along a community greenbelt. However, there is little published information on how these activities impact non-avian riparian wildlife communities.</p>

<p>Modifying riparian areas can influence the availability of habitats used by amphibians and other semi-aquatic and aquatic organisms. Biologists can use species of lizards as indicators to understand the effects of modifying riparian habitats (Bateman et al. 2008). Despite the importance of these species in riparian ecosystems, amphibian and reptile responses to urban habitat rehabilitation are perhaps the least understood of all vertebrates classes (Germaine and Wakeling 2001).</p>

<p>I am proposing to mentor a graduate student to conduct original research focused on evaluating the impacts of riparian rehabilitation on herpetofauna in an urban setting. Our research objectives are to 1) compare habitat characteristics of restored/rehabilitated riparian areas to adjacent un-restored areas, 2) relate abundance of herpetofauna to differences in habitat characteristics, and 3) compare abundance, species richness, and community structure of herpetofauna in restored/rehabilitated riparian areas to adjacent un-restored areas. This project fits within the CAP LTER’s IPA of Human Control of Biodiversity by focusing on how human activities change herpetofauna populations and community structure. This project will contribute to the CAP LTER’s mission, to study how development of the city can alter ecological conditions, by understanding how rehabilitated riparian areas can affect habitat utilized by herpetofauna species.</p>

"381","Fate of combustion-derived carbon deposition in urban soil","<p>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread environmental pollutants produced by incomplete combustion sources such as home heating, biomass burning, and vehicle emissions.  PAH concentrations in soils are influenced by source inputs and environmental factors that control loss processes and soil retention.  Many studies have found higher concentrations of these pollutants in soils within cities of temperate climates that have a centralized urban core.  Less is known about the factors regulating PAH abundance in warm, arid urban ecosystems with low population densities but high traffic volumes.  The relative importance of sources such as motor vehicle traffic load and aridland ecosystem characteristics, including temperature, silt, and organic matter content, were explored as factors regulating PAH concentrations in soils near highways across the metropolitan area of Phoenix, Arizona (USA).  Highway traffic load is high compared to other cities, with an average of 155,000 vehicles per day.  Soils contained low but variable amounts of organic matter (median 2.8 ± 1.8% standard deviation).  Across the city, median PAH concentrations in soil were low relative to other major cities, 523 ± 1,886 ?g•kg-1, ranging from 67 to 10,117 ?g•kg-1.  Diagnostic ratio analyses confirmed that the source of PAHs in Phoenix highway soils is predominantly fuel combustion (i.e. vehicle emissions) rather than petrogenic, biogenic, or other combustion sources (e.g. coal, wood burning).  However, in a multiple regression analysis including traffic characteristics and soil properties, soil organic matter content was the variable most strongly related to PAH concentrations.  Our research suggests that dryland soil characteristics play an important role in the retention of PAH compounds in soils of arid cities.</p>","<p>During summer 2008, samples were taken at 63 sites from major valley-wide Phoenix highways that ranged widely in traffic density and age of highway.  Samples were collected from the top 2cm of soil, taken 0.5 meters away from the road.  Then, in collaboration with Dr. Pierre Herckes (ASU Analytical Chemistry), we developed a method, based on EPA and other common published techniques (EPA Method 8270d, 3630c, and 3550c), to quantify PAH compounds from soils.  In summary, soils were spiked with deuterated PAH standards, extracted with dichloromethane, reduced interferences by silica gel cleanup, and detected on a Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer.  PAHs were quantified from a PAH standard curve and accounted for possible PAH loss during sample processing based on the initial PAH standard spike.  Additionally, to quantify factors that may correlate with PAH concentrations, we measured a suite of soil properties and processes including soil moisture, soil organic matter, water holding capacity, pools of ammonium and nitrate, and pH.  In addition to investigating the distribution of PAH compounds across the city, NSF-funded REU student Tejkaran Dhillon explored how PAH abundance may also vary at smaller deposition scales.  At five sites, we collected surface soils and quantified PAHs at intervals of 0.5, 1.5, 5, and 15m using transects away from the road.  The described research has been completed and published in Water, Air, & Soil Pollution.</p>",NULL
"382","Chemical characterization of biomass and fossil fuel-derived black carbon in Survey 200 soils","<p>This project is investigating the distribution and composition of black carbon (BC) in soil samples collected as part of the CAP LTER-Survey 200. Black carbon, also called charcoal or soot carbon is the product of incomplete organic matter combustion and is operationally defined along a broad continuum from slightly charred biomass to fully graphitic soot (Schmidt and Noack, 2000 that represents a large range in particle size-class, combustion temperatures, reactivity, etc. The two largest sources of black carbon are biomass burning and fossil fuel combustion. The most recent black carbon budget (Kuhlbusch and Crutzen, 1995) was constructed before the development of good community consensus as to analytical procedures and reference materials so, significant uncertainties in the budget remain. The amount and reactivity of black carbon in soils is a significant unknown in global and regional BC budgets. It has been shown that BC can be a large fraction of soil organic carbon (up to 30% by weight; Skjemstad et al. 2002). It is worth noting however, that none of the current information on BC in soils is based on urban soils or on arid-land soils. This research will significantly improve our understanding of the distribution of black carbon in urban soils.</p>","<p>This project will also address the pervasive idea that BC is extremely recalcitrant. While black carbon’s aromatic structure is inherently less reactive than other fresher organic molecules, the best budget estimates for black carbon in the environment do not balance with respect to inputs and losses. Current BC production rates are well known and large, yet, there is no evidence for any large sink for black carbon on land or in the oceans. This means that some fraction of the BC pool must be labile on relatively short time scales or mass balance would dictate implausibly large BC soil pools (Masiello and Druffel, 2003). Black carbon has been shown to be stabilized in soils by interaction with the mineral matrix, in particular with Ca+2 ions (Clough and Skjemstad, 2000). There is also some evidence that soil microbes can, under the right conditions, metabolize BC (Baldock and Smernik, 2002; Hockaday et al. 2006). The factors controlling BC storage in soils are currently very poorly understood, in particular the roles of microbial and UV oxidation and the influence of human land-use and management (Czimczik and Masiello, 2007).</p>
<p>This project utilizes thermo-chemical techniques, 13C-NMR spectroscopy, and ESI-Mass Spectrometry molecular-level analyses (see Masiello, 2004 and references therein for a summary of analytical methods) to characterize the amount and form of black carbon in Survey 200 soil samples. These analyses are done on campus either in the Hartnett Laboratory or in the NMR facility in Chemistry & Biochemistry. Soil samples used in the first phase of this project were chosen to incorporate of range of land-use history, and distance from the urban core. The Survey 200 soil samples, with their ancillary soil chemistry and land-use/cover data are ideal for this project. To date we have analyzed ~50 of the surface soil sample from the 2005 200-point survey (see Results). The following phase of the project will assess the reactivity of black carbon in soils. We plan to examine both bottom (~10cm depth) soils, and soils from the previous survey to assess changes in the amount and form of black carbon in the Phoenix-area soils. The NMR characterization will provide additional quantitative information about the aromatic component of the BC in these soils. In addition to the analysis of Survey-200 samples, we plant to conduct microbial degradation experiments in the laboratory using both black carbon from selected Phoenix-area soils as well as black carbon generated in the laboratory from a variety of organic sources (hydrocarbon, protein, lignin/cellulose).</p> 
<p>This project relates directly to the CAP LTER Integrated Project Area: Fluxes of Materials and Socio-Ecosystem Response. The project is also relevant to the Land-Use and Land-Cover Change IPA. Black carbon is a significant component of soil carbon biogeochemical cycling. Because BC has both natural and anthropogenic sources and it’s distribution and composition in the growing urban region quite variable (see Results). In addition, because black carbon has a long environmental lifetime, it may be possible (through careful sample selection) to investigate how the relative proportion of fire-derived and fossil fuel-derived black carbon has changed over the course of the development of the CAP urban ecosystem. Human activity is known to increase BC relative to non-black soil organic carbon both through land-use practices that either selectively remove soil organic matter (many agricultural practices) or land-use practices that increase the amount of BC present (actual burning and/or tillage of charcoal and ash; Czimczik and Masiello, 2007). The well-known land-use history (desert, agriculture, residential) of the Survey 200 sites is particularly important as it will allow a detailed comparison of BC among sites with different soil chemistry and soil organic carbon compositions. We are beginning to collaborate with Dr. Ramon Arrowsmith in the School of Earth and Space Exploration to determine sampling sites with known fire history and fire scarring that correspond spatially with the Survey 200 sites, in order to provide a context within which to interpret the relative proportion of biomass-derived and fossil fuel-derived black carbon.</p>",NULL
"383","Land-use and land-cover change: A proposal for a pilot study of cash-cropping among the Gila River O'odham","<p>The CAP LTER research area provides a historical case study that is directly relevant to the investigation of the causes and consequences of household changes in farming practices. In this project we propose to investigate how land use, and potentially land cover, changed in the past as Gila River O’odham households markedly increased the cash-cropping of wheat in the mid-1800s. We are particularly interested in the dynamical relations among the social, ecological, economic, and technological factors that caused the O’odham to vastly increase wheat production to sell to the Army and to the Overland Mail Company in the late 1840s and early 1850s (Wilson 1999). While this marked increase in production is documented historically (Castetter and Bell 1942; Wilson 1999), the social, economic, and ecological causes and implications of the resulting change in land use have not been the subject of research.

The demise of this system allows us to engage briefly another of the CAP-LTER IPAs, that of water policy, use, and supply. At the time that the Gila River O’odham were significantly expanding agricultural production along the middle Gila, Anglo farmers further upstream were beginning to divert water to their own crops (Woodson 2003). We propose to investigate how the O’odham households responded to this decrease in access to water. By the late 1870s Anglos were diverting most of the flow in the Gila, resulting in recurring crop failure among the O’odham. Under these conditions, it is unclear whether cash crops or subsistence crops went out of production first, i.e., whether families became more self-reliant for a time as conditions worsened, or were so dependent on Anglos as sources of household commodities that wheat took precedence over subsistence crops (corn, wheat, beans, squash, melons). Interestingly, by the end of the 1800s, as farming became increasingly difficult, O’odham households turned to cutting mesquite for firewood and selling it to the residents of growing Tempe and Phoenix. The result was long-term degradation of the Gila River bed and floodplain (J.A. Darling, Gila River Indian Community, personal communication, 2009). Thus this case study will allow us to engage in multiple cycles of socio-ecological and landscape change in relation to cash-cropping.</p>","<p>Two research reports produced for the Gila River Indian Community, a history of the area by John Wilson (1999) and a history of canal irrigation by Kyle Woodson (2003), provide dozens of historical references that Strawhacker will work with to elicit details of the social and economic contexts of increasing wheat production, spatial changes in field locations, expansions of fields, and changes in the subsistence to cash crop proportions. In addition to this historical research into land use change, historic and modern aerial photographs and high resolution satellite images will be utilized to observe whether there are landscape-scale vegetation and geological (i.e. evidence of erosion) differences between land that was farmed and land that was not farmed during the period of interest.  These data will be imported into a GIS in order to seek patterns of the legacies of agrarian transition and identify areas of future research into the ecological and social impacts of this historic transition. </p>","<p>The proposed project speaks directly to the CAP LTER question concerning: “How have land use and land cover changed in the past?” The Gila River Indian Community (GRIC) represents a landscape that lies outside of, but is becoming engulfed by, urban Phoenix. While Phoenix’s urban area is currently under CAP-LTER investigation with respect to socio-ecological gradients and land-use fragmentation, the large and important portion of the Phoenix Basin that GRIC represents has not been engaged. With the recent water settlement and the GRIC plans to substantially expand agricultural production, the proposed research is likely to inform not only on the ecological and socioeconomic processes that interacted in the past and influence the current GRIC landscape, but also can provide insight on future agriculturally related socio-ecological interactions in this peri-urban portion of the Phoenix Basin. </p>

<p>Broader implications: While this project addresses CAP LTER issues, additional goals are two-fold. Spielmann’s interests lie in identifying a reasonable holistic approach and the appropriate variables to use in analyzing contemporary shifts from subsistence to cash cropping. Strawhacker’s dissertation will focus on prehistoric farming on the Gila River Indian Community, and thus this project will provide an excellent opportunity to understand how the agricultural practices of indigenous communities respond to various external and internal driving forces. </p>"
"384","Historical urban codes","<p>The focus of this project has so far been on compiling historical urban codes from around the
world, and from all time periods. The next phase, which ties more specifically into the CAP2
proposal, is to examine the linkage between current land use regulations and urban form. The
main focus will be to develop a protocol for extracting the rules and regulations that create
particular kinds of urban environments. Such rules constitute the ""DNA"" of urban places, and
include, for example: zoning, transportation regulations, utility requirements, lending rules, and
laws pertaining to institutions (e.g., State rules that mandate the dimensions of school facilities).
There are multiple spatial domains, multiple agencies, and multiple time periods involved
(although the focus will be on current regulations). The research will be limited to those elements
that have an impact on the physical, human-built landscape.</p>","<p>The immediate task for the RA will be to compile the codes, rules, laws, and regulations pertinent
to the Phoenix area - all human exactions affecting urban form. Depending on how many rules
and regulations for dictating urban form are uncovered, it may be necessary to focus only on
targeted locations – “core samples” of urbanism. The second task will be to develop a
methodology for examining 1) the historical evolution of regulations, from simplicity to complexity;
2) changes in the spatial distribution, extent, and subject matter of regulations; and 3) their
composite effect on urban form. A small prototype for this effort has been developed here:
http://codesproject.asu.edu/php/real_life.php, although one of the tasks of the RA will be to refine
this methodology. Ultimately, it may be possible to quantity these changes and their effects into a form suitable for incorporation into CAP LTER modeling and simulation efforts. See http://codesproject.asu.edu/ for larger project description.</p>",NULL
"385","100 Cities Project: Sensing for Solutions &ndash; Bridging Cities and Science","The Urban Environmental Monitoring (UEM) project, now known as the 100 Cities Project, at Arizona State University (ASU) is a baseline effort to collect and analyze remotely sensed data for 100 urban centers worldwide. Our overarching goal is to use remote sensing technology to better understand the consequences of rapid urbanization through advanced biophysical measurements, classification methods, and modeling, which can then be used to inform public policy and planning. Urbanization represents one of the most significant alterations that humankind has made to the surface of the earth. In the early 20th century, there were less than 20 cities in the world with populations exceeding 1 million; today, there are more than 400. The consequences of urbanization include the transformation of land surfaces from undisturbed natural environments to land that supports different forms of human activity, including agriculture, residential, commercial, industrial, and infrastructure such as roads and other types of transportation. Each of these land transformations has impacted, to varying degrees, the local climatology, hydrology, geology, and biota that predate human settlement. It is essential that we document, to the best of our ability, the nature of land transformations and the consequences to the existing environment. The focus in the UEM project since its inception has been on rapid urbanization. Rapid urbanization is occurring in hundreds of cities worldwide as population increases and people migrate from rural communities to urban centers in search of employment and a better quality of life. The unintended consequences of rapid urbanization have the potential to cause serious harm to the environment, to human life, and to the resulting built environment because rapid development constrains and rushes decision making. Such rapid decision making can result in poor planning, ineffective policies, and decisions that harm the environment and the quality of human life. Slower, more thought-out, decision making could result in more favorable outcomes. The harm to the environment includes poor air quality, soil erosion, polluted rivers and aquifers, and loss of wildlife habitat. Human life is then threatened because of increased potential for disease spreading, human conflict, environmental hazards, and diminished quality of life. The built environment is potentially threatened when cities are built in areas that can be impacted by events such as hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes, fires, and landslides. Our goals include assessing the threat of such events on cities and the people living there.","<p>The 100 Cities Project is a platform designed to bring policymakers and researchers together to apply urban remote sensing to the problems of urbanization, the environment, and sustainability.We seek to create meaningful partnerships with cities internationally. As we build our partnerships, we can then develop models of how best to address cities' problems with urban remote sensing. At the same time we are developing relationships with academic researchers who produce urban remote sensing products and use them in their models. </p>

<h4>Our Goals</h4>

<li>Use mapping and modeling results of our urban remote sensing research to advance the understanding of urban development trajectories and urban ""futures"".</li>

<li>Develop an international network of urban data providers, researchers, and end-users to rapidly disseminate and archive data, analytical approaches, and results.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Our Research</h4> 

<p>We are growing our team of researchers and practitioners here at ASU and at other institutions around the world that share datasets and collaborate on publications and research with the 100 Cities Project and among other researchers.</p>

<p>We conduct work on three levels:

<ol>
<li><em>Individual Cities</em>: In-depth specific focus on individual members of the 100 Cities - these cities have researchers and practitioners available to collaborate with us.</li>

<li><em>Categories of Cities</em>:  Mapping and modeling of urban/peri-urban (suburban) climatic, ecologic, and social properties (both current and historic) across multiple cities for detailed comparative study of differing natural environments and urban planning policies.</li>

<li><EM>All 100 Cities</em>: Basic data for all 100 Cities to compare effects of urbanization and supply the international community with standardized urban remote sensing datasets. This includes temperature, vegetation, land classification, and social data. We also provide timely and continuous monitoring of rapidly urbanizing regions using ASTER (and other) remotely sensed datasets.</li>

"386","Advancing Conservation in a Social Context: Working in a World of Trade-Offs","<p>The need to make trade-offs among human livelihoods, biodiversity, and ecosystem services are the rule rather than the exception. This implies that informed choices must be made to achieve the best possible outcomes. The term ""trade-off"" used here does not describe a binary system of winners and losers, but management choices that intentionally or otherwise change the diversity, functioning and services provided by ecosystems over space and time. Trade-offs are made as a result of the interests, actions and ideas between different stakeholders or users, and between different geographic and social scales. Trade-offs exist among different interests and priorities, particularly among economic development, social welfare and conservation goals. Trade-offs also exist between long-term and short-term time horizons, where typically biodiversity conservation as a long-term objective (such as in national park creation) is traded off against short-term economic benefits (such as conversion to agricultural land). The spatial and temporal scales over which conservation and development benefits are realized  as an outcome of the trade-offs &ndash; are rarely commensurate with the scales over which costs are borne. In particular, the benefits may derive regionally or globally while costs are borne locally and costs may be imposed today while benefits are deferred to the future. Other situations may also hold true. For example, increased local genetic and species diversity in agricultural systems often leads to better control of pests and diseases, but the consequent incentive for local protection of biodiversity may not link to any important global values. Moreover, the current mechanisms (market or otherwise) for redistributing costs and benefits in space and in time are often inadequate where they exist at all.</p>  

<p>Win-win scenarios, where both natural resources are conserved and human well-being is improved in specific places over time, have been difficult to realize. Compromise, contestation and even conflict are more often the norm. Although biodiversity conservation might be accomplished with no or minimal impact on human well-being or improvements on development at negligible cost to biodiversity, the challenge for conservationists is to explicitly acknowledge the need to share risks and costs and to find a balance between improving livelihoods and biodiversity conservation. Important issues include how to negotiate these trade-offs, what level of biodiversity loss is acceptable, how human costs might be mitigated and who takes part in the decision-making process. While conservation cannot ignore the needs of human beings, development that runs roughshod over the environment will eventually be unsustainable (or collapse).</p>

<p>Addressing conservation and development trade-offs are difficult because the relationship (or the views people hold about this relationship) between people and nature is so strongly influenced by where they are raised, how they are educated, their life experiences and the survival conditions and options they have faced. Though not necessarily fixed over time in the face of catalytic events, evolving normative frameworks, or other factors, these different beliefs exert a strong influence on behavior. Moreover, they are often contested and typically underlie difficulties in integrating conservation and development aims. In addition, lack of conceptual clarity about terms such as ""biodiversity"" and ""poverty"" inhibits systematic analysis. Shaky assumptions based on piecemeal evidence obscure legitimate differences in preferences and limit the effectiveness of policy and programmatic interventions. We need to better understand how groups with different values, points-of-view and backgrounds formulate their approaches to conservation and development challenges and how this, in turn, affects responses.</p>

<p>In an effort to address these issues, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation have supported the development of an interdisciplinary research initiative called Advancing Conservation in a Social Context (ACSC). The ACSC research initiative is designed as a five-year project. In order to reach the overall goal of improving the ability of key actors to identify, analyze, and negotiate future conservation and development trade-offs, the initiative will take place in two phases. During the three-year first phase of the project, the ACSC initiative will undertake a program of formative research to increase understanding and the applicability of knowledge about trade-offs by key actors. This approach will be grounded in a comparative analysis of three case study countries &ndash; Vietnam, Tanzania and Peru &ndash; that is designed to build knowledge that contributes to addressing such trade-off issues within those countries and more broadly in other country contexts and the international arena. The two-year second phase of the project seeks to accelerate the pace at which the findings from the research is adopted, adapted and implemented by practitioners. The strategy for this process of investigation and diffusion will be to engage a range of institutions and organizations, including multi- and bilateral development agencies and banks, government departments, conservation and development NGOs, community-based organizations, the private sector, academic institutions, and foundations and other donors, in order to learn from their experiences &ndash; both the positive and negative lessons &ndash; and work with them to enhance collective understanding of and ability to address possible trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and human well-being.</p>  

<p>The ACSC Research Initiative is organized around three functional units: 1) A host institution providing a fertile intellectual milieu and financial and administrative oversight to the initiative &ndash; the Global Institute of Sustainability at Arizona State University; 2) an implementation team, led by a principal investigator with technical support and research coordination in the three case study countries, working under the host institution but fully responsible for implementation of the initiative. Case study country research will be hosted by local institutions with extensive experience in the conservation and development fields in each country (e.g., in Vietman &ndash; the Centre for Natural Resources and Environmental Studies at the Vietnam National University, Hanoi; in Tanzania &ndash; Sokoine University of Agriculture, Department of Wildlife Management, Morogoro; and in Peru &ndash; Sociedad Peruana de Derecho Ambiental, Lima; and 3) An advisory committee made up of selected experts in the field of conservation and development providing technical input and rigor during the research phase. </p>","<p>Advancing Conservation in a Social Context: Working in a World of Trade-offs (ACSC) is a five-year international, interdisciplinary research initiative supported by the John D. and Catherine T.

The program of research will contribute to improved conservation practice through a better understanding of the conditions under which natural resources are sustained over time, at a meaningful scale and in complex social-ecological contexts. </p>

<p>The ACSC research initiative has been created to investigate the complex trade-offs that exist between human well-being and biodiversity conservation goals in specific places, and between conservation and other economic, political and social agendas at local, national and international scales.

"387","Agrarian Landscapes in Transition: A Cross-Scale Approach","This interdisciplinary project traced the effects of the introduction, spread, and abandonment of agriculture at six U.S. long-term ecological research (LTER) sites, with cross comparisons in Mexico and France. Agrarian transformations represent the most pervasive alteration of the Earth's terrestrial environment during the past 10,000 years. Many current conceptualizations of these transformations, however, assume a simple linear model -- change is driven by present-day economic, demographic, and technological conditions. This project incorporates a more integrated and long-term cycle: of land-use change affecting landscapes, of altered landscapes affecting ecological processes, and of both influencing the ways in which humans monitor and respond to their surroundings, engendering further cycles of change. The central objective of this research is to identify and quantify the ways in which these integrated cycles differ across cultures, across biogeographic regions, and across time. A suite of quantitative and narrative analyses will be used to identify the prime determinants of long-term dynamics, present-day patterns, and reservoirs of ecological and social resilience in these systems. Analytical approaches will include structural-equation modeling, analysis of spatial and causal effects, and cross-site comparisons of case studies. As a practical test of the project's results, approaches and insights will be examined in the context of conservation planning at The Nature Conservancy (TNC) that includes an emphasis on eco-regional planning and scenario building. This investigation will contribute to both science and society in six ways. First, it will demonstrate the importance of social-science information and approaches in ecosystem investigations, expanding the results of the LTER network and breaching the divide between social and natural science. The data protocols developed will also benefit other communities of social and natural scientists through the involvement of ICPSR, the main national repository of social science data. Second, this project will help to develop general theories on how socio-ecological legacies, as well as lags in the recognition of and response to change, vary across space and time. Third, through detailed case histories and quantitative analyses, the project expects to provide convincing evidence that humans act not only to disturb ecosystems, but also monitor ecosystem values and respond to maintain stability and minimize crises. Fourth, project results will provide information of direct use to policy makers, TNC, and land managers by using an approach that explicitly relates socio-ecological processes to varying levels of political organization. Fifth, the cross-scale data collection and analyses are expected to demonstrate that some patterns of human-ecological interactions are surprisingly long term, vary across space and time, and are non-linear. The greatest contribution will be through education at a variety of levels; this project will train new interdisciplinary scientists at all levels of the educational spectrum, inform public officials, and contribute to more effective land management practices.",NULL,"This interdisciplinary project traced the effects of the introduction, spread, and abandonment of agriculture at six U.S. long-term ecological research (LTER) sites, with cross comparisons in Mexico and France, using a variety of monitoring strategies, quantitative modeling, and comparative data.

"388","Archaeological Data Integration for the Study of Long-Term Human and Social Dynamics",NULL,"<p>A lack of millennial- or centennial-scale data seriously impairs scientific investigations of social and socioenvironmental systems. In developing and testing socioecological models, we must do more than project recent observations-reflecting at most a few decades-into the past or future. Archaeology can provide the long-term data on societies and environments that are needed to better illuminate such critical topics as demography, economy and social stability. The complexities of archaeological data, lack of data comparability across projects and limited access to primary data have crippled current efforts to understand phenomena operating on large spatiotemporal scales. Nonetheless, the potential for archaeological insights to contribute to the study of long-term human and social dynamics is enormous; the fundamental challenge is to enable scientifically meaningful integration and use of the expanding corpus of archaeological data.</p> 

<p><em>Intellectual Merit</em>. A two-year long investigation of the information-integration demands of archaeology-supported by a National Science Foundation HSD exploratory grant-revealed fundamental technical challenges that cannot be handled by a straightforward adaptation of existing technologies. In response, a team of archaeologists and computer scientists proposes to implement a Knowledge-Based Archaeological Data Integration System (KADIS) that employs novel, query-driven ad hoc data integration strategies. Once archaeologists have registered datasets though KADIS, researchers across scientific disciplines could, over the Web, extract sensibly integrated and appropriately scaled databases of analytically comparable observations from numerous archaeological datasets gathered using incommensurate recording protocols. Although initial development of KADIS will focus on fauna from archaeological contexts, it establishes an open-source, extensible foundation for a global, archaeological information infrastructure. The project will establish the capacity to build and access a worldwide archive of primary data representing the full history of human use of animals. Concept-oriented queries of this archive will advance socioecological modeling efforts and allow scientists to address large-scale and long-term social and natural science questions with empirical support that has heretofore been unthinkable. Testbed research will investigate the socioenvironmental conditions that lead to depressed abundance of preferred game-over two millennia in two US regions. </p>

<p><em>Broader Scientific Impacts</em>. Query-driven, ad hoc integration architecture will be applicable to many other science informatics domains in which complex inferences need to be made over multiple heterogeneous, inconsistent, and context-dependent sources. Using KADIS, specialists in other fields could use intermediate-level archaeological knowledge to obtain to primary data scaled to the scope of their inquiries. By providing scholars in diverse fields with meaningful access to long-term data on society, population, and environment, archaeology can help explain the complex human and social dynamics that have constituted today's social world and shaped the modern environment. </p>

<p>Impacts on the infrastructure of social and natural science extend far beyond the traditional boundaries of academia. KADIS addresses critical needs of private, tribal, and governmental archaeology programs. In addition, it enables serious archaeological research by individuals outside academia and those lacking physical or financial capacity to do fieldwork. It provides a means to maintain the long-term utility and accessibility of irreplaceable primary data in the face of inadequate metadata and rapidly changing technology. </p>

<p><em>Broader Societal and Educational Impacts.</em> This research will engage a multidisciplinary team of graduate assistants and undergraduate interns and will be a testbed for Computer Science students to explore key issues of science informatics. Undergraduates worldwide can become a new community of users as critical thinking exercises in anthropology courses are redesigned to employ large-scale research datasets using KADIS, rather than the artificial data usually analyzed.</p>","This integrative project will address the challenge of enabling scientifically meaningful integration and use of the expanding body of archaeological data."
"389","Arizona Hydrological Information System","<p>In a 2005 statewide survey of researchers, water management decision-makers, industry representatives and many others, the most frequent request from stakeholders in the water resources community was better access to water-related data. In response, the Arizona Water Institute (AWI) designated the Arizona Hydrologic Information System (AHIS) as one of its priority projects. AHIS will provide a one-stop resource for water-related data across the state of Arizona, linking users with widespread and diverse information sources. The system will connect government agencies, the three state universities, county and municipal governments, and databases developed and maintained in the private sector. Its user-friendly format and services will not only enable simple access, but will also allow visualization and manipulation of data to aid in forming responses to complex questions.</p>

<p>AHIS development began as one of AWI's four first-year projects in 2006. In collaboration with developers at the <a href=""http://www.arizona.edu/"" target=""blank"">University of Arizona</a> NSF <a href=""http://www.sahra.arizona.edu/"" target=""blank"">Science & Technology Center (STC) for Sustainability of semi-Arid Hydrology and Riparian Areas (SAHRA)</a> and at state agencies in Arizona, the <a href=""http://www.sahra.arizona.edu/wells/""  target=""blank"">ArizonaWells</a> and <a href=""http://arizonawater.org/"" target=""blank"">ArizonaWater</a> components were developed. In 2007, AWI funded a project to develop this prototype web service &ndash; the ""information backbone"" of the Arizona Water Institute &ndash; to connect with stored information from numerous sources. Our staff and affiliated researchers have been working on this web portal in order to match these web services to data at the the <a href=""http://www.azwater.gov/azdwr/"" target=""blank"">Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR),</a>, <a href=""http://www.azdeq.gov/"" target=""blank"">Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ)</a>, the <a href=""http://www.srpnet.com/"" target=""blank"">Salt River Project (SRP)</a> and numerous valuable information providers from federal to local levels. Many of these data providers also contribute to AHIS as development partners, facilitating access to locally-held information through specific project partnerships and their generous contribution of IT resources and efforts oriented on access to archived and real-time information sources.","<p>AHIS provides a comprehensive framework for knowledge management and information discovery using data related to physiographic surveys, hydrologic observations, and water resources monitoring and assessment throughout the State of Arizona. The development of AHIS is a state-wide, collaborative effort led by AWI and involving three state universities (the University of Arizona, Arizona State University, and Northern Arizona University), three state administrative departments (the Arizona Departments of Water Resources, Environmental Quality, and Commerce), numerous federal agencies (e.g., the USGS, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Bureau of Land Management, and the National Weather Service), regional water and power providers (e.g., the Central Arizona Project, the Salt River Project, and local water utilities), county and municipal organizations throughout the state, tribal authorities, nongovernmental organizations, and volunteer observer networks.</p>

<p>The goal of the AHIS initiative is to bring together the information held and provided by these entities regarding all aspects of water availability, quality, and use so that:

<ol>
<li>these data can be more widely disseminated to the user community,</li> 
<li>the combination of multiple data sources and types may lead to the development of new information and knowledge by correlation and analysis, and</li>
<li>the combined wealth of data may be of greater use to stakeholders and decision-makers in water-related communities of practice.</li>
</ol> 
<p>The approach to AHIS development remains inherently multi-disciplinary and addresses the needs of data collectors, providers and consumers in numerous water-related fields from both scientific and engineering perspectives. It is intended that the data clearinghouse and analytical tools made available in AHIS will provide invaluable support to governmental agencies and affiliated policymakers, tribal organizations and groups, private firms and consulting services, and academic research and technology development for hydrology- and water-related planning, education and outreach within Arizona and throughout the arid and semi-arid Southwest.</p>","This project is developing the information infrastructure needed to access data on water-related research, technology, planning, education, and outreach from multiple sources in the Southwest."

Launched in 1997 along with the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) as the first urban LTER sites, CAP LTER has been instrumental in establishing urban ecology as a recognized and important area of ecological inquiry.</p>

<p>The central research question that guides the project's research is: How do the services provided by evolving urban ecosystems affect human outcomes and behavior, and how does human action (responses) alter patterns of ecosystem structure and function, and ultimately, urban sustainability, in a dynamic environment?</p>

<p>With an emphasis on ecosystem services, sustainability, and change, we ask three subsidiary research questions corresponding to different portions of our conceptual framework:

<ul>
<li>Urban ecosystem services: How does urbanization change the structure and function of ecosystems and thereby alter the services provided by those ecosystems?</li>
<li>Human outcomes and actions/responses: How do people perceive and respond to ecosystem services, how are the services' effects distributed spatially and with reference to characteristics of the population, and how do individual and collective behaviors further change ecosystem structure and function?</li>
<li>Urbanization in a dynamic world: How does the larger context of biophysical drivers (e.g., climate change) and societal drivers (e.g., immigration or regional urbanization) influence the interaction and feedbacks between ecosystems and society as mediated through ecosystem services, and thereby influence the future of the urban ecosystem?</li>
</ul></p>
In addressing these questions, CAP LTER researchers focus on a broad geographic area in central Arizona and metropolitan Phoenix where two major desert tributaries of the Colorado River, the Salt and Gila Rivers, converge.</p>

<p>The edges of this geographic focal area remain fluid to allow scientists to investigate urban influences beyond these boundaries, conduct comparative work, and examine issues related to the growing megapolitan area between the greater Phoenix and Tucson areas. </p>","The Central Arizona&ndash;Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research (CAP LTER) project is one of 26 long-term sites funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF).

"394","Decision Center for a Desert City","<p>The confluence of rapid population growth and the threat of global warming in an uncertain climate environment pose challenging policy and decision-making issues for the urbanizing desert of Central Arizona. The Decision Center for a Desert City (DCDC) coordinates a program of interdisciplinary research and community outreach to improve water-management decisions in central Arizona. To that end, DCDC studies the cognitive processes by which individuals and water managers make decisions, apply sophisticated models of decision science to water-allocation problems, develop GIS-based decision-support tools that foster better long-term and more integrated decision making, use climate models to define the dimensions of uncertain water availability both locally and regionally, and develop innovative educational programs organized around water, climate, and decision making. DCDC seeks to build a new model of science and policy engagement that allows decision makers and scientists to collaborate on important research questions and experiment with new methods.</p>

<p>Even the best climate science cannot reduce significantly the uncertainty associated with global climate change, the climate cycles that lead to droughts and floods, and the expanding and intensifying urban heat island that now grips the rapidly growing Phoenix area. In collaboration with local, state, and regional water managers, DCDC will produce basic interdisciplinary research about water availability, climatic uncertainty, and human decision making, create decision support tools to foster better water-management decisions, develop scenarios of different water futures and share them with decision makers and the public, and investigate the nature of research activity and decision making within DCDC itself for lessons about to build an effective organization at the boundary of science and policy. DCDC is closely aligned with Arizona State University's Decision Theater, a 3-D immersive space for visualization and outreach to the community. Many of the nation's, and indeed the world's, most rapidly growing urban areas are in arid environments and face a future of greater water uncertainty. Arid cities therefore will benefit from a clearer articulation of the effects of climate change on urban water demand and supply and on community response to growing uncertainty.

<p>At the Energy, Society and Policy Initiative (ESPI), our emphasis is on the social dynamics of energy system transformation and on appropriate policy development to ensure that processes of energy system transformation contribute to the solution of wider and deeper forms of societal injustice within which energy systems have long held a central position. Like all technological systems, energy systems are not just systems of machinery; they are also intimately interwoven into people's lives, livelihoods, and lifestyles. People from all walks of life, in all parts of the globe, are employees and consumers of and investors in energy systems. Energy systems are enormous generators of wealth, generating at the same time massive cycles of boom and bust in local economies. Energy system are global in reach, connecting individual lives and livelihoods at sites of production, conversion, distribution, and consumption in a web of intricate social, economic, and political relationships. Energy policy must therefore account not only for the technology and economics of energy systems but their social relationships and forms of justice and injustice. Only by so doing might it be possible to achieve energy system transformation that achieves the best outcomes not only for technical and economic efficiency but also for human wellbeing and welfare.</p> 
 

<p>Our objective in ESPI is to establish a strong program of research and policy engagement that seeks to understand and analyze the social dynamics of past, present, and future energy systems and to develop and design reflexive mechanisms of energy systems governance by which humanistic and social science research can inform the process of energy system transformation to create enhanced societal outcomes around the globe.</p>","ESPI's objective is to to establish a strong program of research and policy engagement to understand and analyze the social dynamics of past, present, and future energy systems."

"398","Integrated Analysis of Robustness in Dynamic Social Ecological Systems",NULL,"<p>Society faces rapidly accelerating environmental change and uncertainty about the consequences of this change. Society must thus develop mechanisms to navigate disturbances and change in the environment. There are many examples of both long-lived societies which have successfully faced such challenges, and have failed. These examples may provide important guiding principles for policy design under uncertainty. By exploiting data on a set of relatively simple societies relating to their responses to changes in particular classes of environmental risks, this project will build and analyze set of models of social change. These results will be combined with qualitative analysis of the case studies to deepen our understanding of the characteristics of social-ecological systems that confer robustness to particular disturbances. This analysis will help us predict when alternative responses to disturbance and environmental change will succeed and how they will most likely fail.</p>
<p>The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is the development of a new, integrated approach to study how societies deal with uncertainty, disturbance and change. By applying a range of complementary quantitative approaches to models developed based on a large set of case studies, we will develop tools able to cope with more complexity than traditional approaches in resource economics. At the same time, we will keep the models simple enough to exploit powerful tools developed in mathematics and engineering to obtain general results. Our research is targeted between the extremes of simple bioeconomic models typically employed in resource economics and
extremely complex, difficult to analyze simulation models used in environmental science. Further, the project is not only innovative in its approach, but in the questions it asks. It is an attempt to move beyond traditional approaches and focus on a fundamentally different, and arguably more important question: what robustness and vulnerability trade-offs do societies face in dealing with ecological and social complexity, uncertainty and change?</p>
<p>The broader impacts of the proposed activity will be felt in areas of resource management and mathematical education. Management practitioners are faced with such uncertainty that ""optimal"" management policies are of little use. Adaptive management emerged in the 1970's in response to the inadequacy of traditional approaches. However, adaptive management with its own challenges of replicating large scale experiments has produced few successes.

The NSF, NIH, and National Academies all recognize the need to increase numeracy to remain a leader in new knowledge production. Providing opportunities for students to learn mathematics in context is a critical component of any program aimed at improving numeracy. The educational component of this project, combined with ongoing activities at ASU will immerse students in research at the boundary of natural and social sciences involving mathematics through one-on-one mentoring and targeted summer workshops. Thus, our project will contribute to a critical need in the
United States to increase numeracy and maintain global leadership in new knowledge production.</p>","This project asks: Why are some socioecological systems more successful in navigating environmental disturbances and change than others?"
"399","Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training in Urban Ecology","<p>This project will provide integrative graduate education, research, and training in the crossdisciplinary field of urban ecology. Cities are not only important ecosystems to humans but represent excellent laboratories for ecological research. Urban areas exhibit distinct boundaries, landscape patchiness, high levels of exotic species, and conditions that mimic global-scale change (elevated CO2 and temperature). Rapidly urbanizing Phoenix is one of only two urban sites in the National Science Foundation's LTER network, creating an excellent opportunity for frontier, multidisciplinary research and graduate training and for collaborations that integrate the social and natural sciences. The intellectual merit of this activity lies in the challenge of bringing
multiple disciplines together to train students to understand and manage liveable, sustainable cities in a manner consistent with regional and global-scale ecological values.</p>
<p>Arizona State University's IGERT in urban ecology emphasizes training in life science, earth science, and social science. Training will involve team research, interdisciplinary ""issues"" seminars, dissertation research in some aspect of urban ecology, broadly construed, and an international experience. The project will pay explicit attention to the conduct of research (including interdisciplinary collaboration, group dynamics, and the responsible conduct of research) and the engagement of science with law, policy, and the public sphere. Unlike most PhD programs in the US, which are based upon scientific independence, ASU's IGERT will both use and investigate the efficacy of interdependence (collaboration, cooperation) as a research mode. The premise is that scientific investigation in important areas such as cities is increasingly multidisciplinary, yet students receive little direct training or experience in collaborative strategies and group dynamics. This project will thus provide innovative graduate training appropriate to multi-investigator, multidisciplinary research.</p>
<p>This second five-year funding period builds upon substantial investment over the last five years and effectiveness won by concerted trial and error. This next phase coincides with a major reorganization of ASU's four campuses, a synthesis of five new schools from innumerable traditional departments, and a focus on interdisciplinarity as an organizing principle. IGERT faculty members and students are strategically placed to both inform and influence this reorganization. A new University Initiative on Disciplinary Integration has been stimulated in part by IGERT activities and involves IGERT faculty members as leaders. The broader impact
of this effort lies in its scientific understanding of urban dynamics and in a lowering of discipline-related barriers to innovative, socially relevant graduate education at this and other American universities.</p>","<p>The main objective of the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) in Urban Ecology is to educate a new kind of life, earth, or social scientist who is broader, more flexible, more collaborative, and more adept at linking science and social issues.</p>
<p>Training is built on a model emphasizing collaboration and teamwork. Fellows can earn degrees in a core discipline of the life, earth, or social science. They also participate in team research, courses, and seminars that emphasize integration among collaborative components beyond the student's home discipline. Collectively, these activities afford skills that are broadly applicable to careers in public and private sectors and in academia.</p>

<h4>Urban Ecology: An Integrating Theme</h4>
<p>Urban ecology is the organizing research theme of our IGERT. This theme incorporates the spatial scale characteristic of urban regions, the long-term perspective of the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program, and a comparative view of natural and human-dominated systems. The organizing question of the Central Arizona&ndash;Phoenix LTER is:</p>

<p><strong>How does the pattern of development of cities alter ecological conditions of the cities and their surrounding environments, and how do ecological changes feed back on further development via the human social system?</strong></p>

<p>This question obviously takes a different form in the collective mind of each discipline of our program; however, within each, it is inherently integrative (drawing broadly from subdisciplines). Even more significant is that by analyzing approaches to and answers from an array of disciplines, we can achieve what might be considered a meta-integration provided by a interdisciplinary perspective.</p>

<p>IGERT 2, our second five-year funding period, builds upon substantial investment over the past five years and effectiveness won by concerted trial and error. This phase coincides with a major reorganization of ASU's four campuses, a synthesis of several new schools from traditional departments, and a focus on interdisciplinarity as an organizing principle.

"401","Legacies on the Landscape: Prehistoric Human Land Use and Long-Term Ecological Change ",NULL,"<p>This project is a collaborative effort by archaeologists and ecologists to investigate the legacy of prehistoric and modern human land use on the mesas of Agua Fria National Monument north of the Phoenix Basin. This desert grassland and riparian ecosystem has experienced two intense pulses of human use in the past 750 years: a sizeable agricultural occupation in the 1300s and livestock grazing since the mid 1800s. We are working to reconstruct key ecological and archaeological features of the landscape before, during, and after (in the case of the indigenous occupation) these pulses of human land-use. Our overarching questions are:
  
<ul><li>How did 14th century economics, politics, and religious practices influence the ways in which people used the Agua Fria landscape?</li>
<li>Which prehistoric activities left ecological legacies that are detectable on contemporary landscapes?</li>
<li>Which ecological conditions make an ecosystem more or less prone to long-lasting human-induced disturbance?</li>
<li>Can we still see effects of an increase in ecological patchiness we would expect in association with the 14th century occupation? </li>
<li>How do legacies of prehistoric land use persist in the face of intensive grazing?</li></ul></p>
 
<p>The goal of the project is to build theory about what types of human disturbances leave legacies over different time scales, and gain insights into the ways that today's actions can affect future ecological systems.</p> 

<p>To begin addressing our research questions project personnel have spent two field seasons collecting a diversity of ecological and archaeological data. These data include the distribution of woody plants, small mammals, herbaceous plants, agaves, rocks, and artifacts at several survey locations. Additionally, the architectural growth of two prehistoric villages has been reconstructed through analyses of the wall alignments and the bonding and abutting patterns at the corners of rooms. Prehistoric agricultural fields have been located and several were selected for additional herbaceous plant surveys, soil analyses, and seed bank studies. At a landscape scale, one study has tracked woody plant expansion utilizing historic aerial photos and another developed a GIS model of potential prehistoric agricultural land.

"403","Long-Term Coupled Socioecological Change in the American Southwest and Northern Mexico","<p>Each generation transforms an inherited social and environmental world and leaves it as a legacy to succeeding generations. Long-term interactions among social and ecological processes give rise to complex dynamics on multiple temporal and spatial scales -- cycles of change followed by relative stasis and then a new cycle of change. Within the cycles are understandable patterns and irreducible uncertainties. Neither stability nor transformation can be taken as the norm. Although these cycles can be identified, it remains uncertain what fosters stability or contributes to transformation over long cycles. What vulnerabilities can be tolerated, and which tip a system into transformation and at what scale? Resilience theorists have built an understanding of social and ecological vulnerabilities, stability, and transformation based on studies of contemporary socioecological systems. This interdisciplinary research project will examine some of these understandings by applying archaeological and ecological analyses and formal dynamical modeling. The project will be undertaken by a collaboration of archaeologists, mathematical modelers, ecologists, and environmental scientists. Archaeology is attuned to cycles of change over the lifespan of a society -- heightened inter-societal interaction, economic intensification, and large-scale anthropogenic environmental change . It therefore extends scientific observation of stability and transformation beyond all social memory. Archaeologically documented case studies in the American Southwest and Northern Mexico provide the information for investigating long-term human-environmental interactions. The project will (1) compile documentation on up to four archaeological cases, (2) examine their pan-regional connections, and (3) employ mathematical modeling and subsequent archaeological and ecological analysis to abstract the key variables and processes underlying periods of cultural stability and both rapid and protracted transformations. The empirical investigations provide substantive contexts for the models, while the models will foster insight into generalizations that are then examined in empirical contexts. This iterative process is expected to lead to insights that could not be derived from any single approach, nor can they be derived from the short time span available in contemporary study of social or ecological change.</p>

<p>This project will influence the refinement of theory and understanding of processes of socioecological change. First, an intensive collaboration of archaeologists specializing in the American Southwest and Northern Mexico will contribute a new level of understanding of the social and environmental interactions underlying important episodes in human history. Second, through archaeology's deep time perspective, this project will examine the utility of resilience theory as applied to coupled socioecological systems, demonstrate the value of archaeology to ecological theory, and further scientific understanding of current socioecological problems through refinement of concepts and theory. Third, this project will identify the dynamics of transformation and stability as conditioned by cultural and environmental contexts, strategies for coping with uncertainty, and varying constraints of long-term legacies. This project is expected to promote awareness of some of the human strategies for dealing with uncertainty and change as well as awareness of how human actions leave legacies of resilience or degradation. In addition, this project will immerse students in an interdisciplinary research community that will spark development of professional skills and encourage them to exchange knowledge about coupled human and environmental systems. The involvement of students and researchers from the U.S., Mexico, France, and the many nations represented in the Resilience Alliance will foster global perspectives and international collaborations.

"404","Mediterranean Landscape Dynamics Project ","<p>All of modern society depends ultimately on the products of agriculture and animal herding. When this agropastoral economy first appeared in the Mediterranean basin in the early Holocene, nearly 10,000 years ago, it represented a dramatic reorganization of human ecology. It involved increasingly intensive efforts by farming peoples to control environmental factors favorable to the life cycle of domestic plants and animals, with a consequent cascade of complexly interlinked effects on regional landscapes and human society. Agropastoral land use remains the most significant way in which humans impact natural landscapes, and the recursive social effects of these impacts are important global issues. However, landscape evolution takes place over the course of decades, centuries, and even millennia. Even the loss of a landscape's ability to support a people and their subsistence economy is often the result of longer-term changes that are most apparent at the resolution of the prehistoric record. Only by studying this long-term record can people truly begin to appreciate the real consequences of past and present land-use decisions on earth's landscapes and society and use this understanding to make more informed decisions today. The longest and best-studied record of the ways in which human activities have transformed the world is found in the Mediterranean Basin, encompassing both the earliest known agricultural land use and the earliest civilizations to become dependent on these human-managed socioecosystems. Decades of intensive study by archaeologists, geoscientists, and ecologists have amassed rich and diverse data about human-environmental interaction in this region. This interdisciplinary research project will integrate this information with recent advances in geospatial modeling and agent simulation to create a natural laboratory for investigating the long-term social and ecological consequences of alternate land-use practices. In this project, the modeling laboratory will be used to study (1) the effects the of growth in agropastoral systems on biodiversity; (2) the changing impacts of land-use intensification and diversification on landscapes, their resilience, and vulnerability to degradation; and (3) the long-term sustainability of human maintained socioecosystems in varying environmental and social contexts. The study will focus on two ecologically diverse regions at opposite ends of the Mediterranean Basin, eastern Spain and the southern Levant in Jordan. These two regions encompass much of the social and natural variability of the entire Mediterranean Basin.</p>

<p>This project will generate significant new knowledge about long-term consequences of alternative land-use practices that can help communities make more responsible and effective decisions about land use today. It will also generate integrated archaeological and paleoenvironmental datasets, and dynamic land use-landscape modeling algorithms that will be disseminated via the internet, conferences, and publications for use by researchers addressing other socioecological questions. The research is tightly integrated with an active educational program for undergraduate and graduate students especially geared towards hands on training in the research process, and collaborative transdisciplinary work. This includes a K-12 outreach partnership with the Arizona Geographic Alliance and collaboration with educators to co-develop and disseminate curricula that enables science learning within the context of core requirements of the No Child Left Behind legislation.

"407","Environmental Justice in Baltimore","<p>Urbanization is one of the most significant changes in the human condition over the last century. As cities become habitat for the majority of the world's people, new challenges arise. Bringing together diverse groups in relatively compact areas has led to inequities based on class, race, and other social dynamics. Segregation and clustering of people and land use and the uneven distribution of environmental amenities and disamenities mean that some groups will suffer more from living near undesirable land uses, while others groups may enjoy disproportionate benefits from residing near desirable land uses. Unmasking such patterns of inequity and the processes responsible for creating them falls under the broad rubric of environmental justice, a growing field of scholarship to which this project will contribute in new and innovative ways. Through an interdisciplinary, longitudinal, intensive case study of Baltimore, the researchers will identify and explain the spatial and temporal dynamics of environmental equity patterns and processes in a large, post-industrial city that has undergone profound socioeconomic change. The project will employ three new methods: (1) The investigators will combine a longitudinal analysis of the patterns of environmental inequity (outcome equity) and the processes that lead to those patterns (process equity) over the long term, from 1880 to the present, a period of rapid industrialization as well as significant economic and population change. The vast majority of environmental justice studies focus on outcome equity with only a cursory treatment of the processes that create those patterns. A systematic examination of equity patterns and processes over the long term, using proximity to Toxics Release Inventory, heavy manufacturing sites as a disamenity, and parks and greenspace as an amenity, will provide a robust, documented, and accessible dataset that will illuminate the relationships between population characteristics and amenities/disamenities, their changes over time, and the impact of the legacies of past dynamics on present patterns. (2) The investigators project will integrate Geographically Weighted Regression with temporal analysis of equity patterns. This method will answer the fundamental question in environmental justice research of whether environmental equity patterns display spatial and temporal nonstationarity, where the relationship between dependent and independent variables may vary over space and time. (3) Long-term data collection and analysis will allow the team to test if there are global relationships between amenity/disamenity densities that relate to shifts in neighborhood characteristics. The longitudinal dataset also will permit an analysis of temporal lags to test if and when population characteristics change after critical amenity/disamenity thresholds are reached.</p>

<p>In broad terms, findings from this study will strengthen scientific understanding of the dynamic relationships among population, land use, and built form of metropolitan areas. Results from this project will provide key new knowledge and data for urbanization models as well as necessary understanding to support meaningful attempts to mitigate environmental injustice. The data, findings, and educational activities from this study will actively contribute to long-term understanding of environmental justice legacies, discrepancies, and potential levers for remediation. The research will build upon existing research and resources from the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) and the Urban Ecology Collaborative (UEC), an expanding network of public and nonprofit partners across seven cities in the northeast U.S. that seek to create healthy urban ecosystems. The project will encourage active stewardship of Baltimore's environment by diverse racial and ethnic groups through the BES's extensive partnerships with public and nonprofit agencies. Dissemination of research results to managers of environmental initiatives will be expedited by these partnerships, and the BES and UEC will incorporate data and results from this study into their respective high-school curricula efforts. Graduate and undergraduate students will be active participants in the project research, workshops, and meetings and will be trained in integrated urban ecology research, a core education and research principle of the participating institutions.</p>

Many of the most important and significant changes associated with the impact of globalization are taking place in urban areas. More than half of the world's population live in urban areas and more than 90 percent of future population growth is likely to be concentrated in cities, and mainly in poor countries. Rapid growth of population and its concentration in urban areas have significant implications for the long-term outlook for humanity. Burdened with many problems associated with growth, urban areas are increasingly subject to dramatic crises. This is especially true in poor countries where economic and financial crises, together with fast and unbalanced growth of urban areas, have created fragmented spaces with high spatial segregation that aggravates the social exclusion characteristic of those societies. The aforementioned problems play an important role in the interactions between urban areas and global environmental change. These interactions create a diversity of impacts that can be grouped in two broad categories: those originating in urban areas that have a negative effect on global environmental change, and global environmental changes that have negative effects on urban areas.</p>

<p>Despite their growing importance, urban areas have been understudied in the analysis of global environmental change, with a majority of research placing emphasis on the impacts of urban areas on global environmental change. Research efforts focus particularly on the contributions of emissions of greenhouse gases and the heat island effect to global climate change. Much less attention has been devoted to the study of the impacts of global environmental change on urban areas and the people who live in them. Particularly critical are the conditions in poor countries.</p>

<p>This core project seeks to fill this gap. Its goal is to develop a better understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between global environmental change and urbanization at the local, regional, and global scales. Its strategy is to create a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary perspective of these issues through innovative conceptual and methodological approaches. Its science plan puts emphasis on global environmental change both as driver and outcome of human (economic, political, cultural, and social) and physical (urban structure, expansion, and land use) processes in urban areas. In this way, urbanization is viewed as both endogenous and exogenous to global environmental change, and the research strategy aims to study them as a tightly coupled system. The science plan of the core project has four thematic foci that cover the array of interaction between the urban and the global environment components of the Earth system. The conceptual framework starts with processes within the urban system that contribute to global environment change (Theme 1). A second focus (Theme 2) is on the pathways through which specific global environmental changes affect the urban system. Once these pathways and points of intersection are identified, the framework addresses the resulting interactions and responses within the urban system (Theme 3). Finally, the framework centres on the consequences of the interactions within the urban system on global environmental change, or feedback processes (Theme 4). These four thematic foci create a comprehensive perspective of the dynamic, diverse, and complex interactions between urban systems and global environmental change processes. Fundamental to the process are different levels of interaction and interconnectivity in the conceptual framework that focuses on:

<ul><li>Interaction among dimensions within urban areas and global environmental change (social, cultural, economic, political, and biophysical)</li>
<li>Cross-temporal and cross-spatial scale approaches</li>
<li>Parallel and comparative studies across regions and time</li>
<li>Interactions among different actors and networks involved in complex dynamics in urban areas</li>
<li>Research that provides effective communication of results to the public and policymakers</li></ul></p>

<p>The short, middle, and long-term strategies of the core project have been designed to accomplish the goals and objectives of the core project through its 10-year life cycle. They include actions for research, policy and educational outreach, and fund-raising. Together, they involve fostering an environment of continued learning and incorporating feedbacks to strengthen the core project as it evolves over time. However, this scientific plan, like any other plan, requires periodic assessments. The core project plans to organize annual workshops to assess the development of its research agenda, as well as large scientific conferences at the end of each five years to assess the development of the core project, enhance its visibility, and make re-adjustments for further development.</p>","This collaborative project is building greater knowledge and understanding of the bidirectional interactions between global environmental change and cities, present at local, regional, and global scales, and integrating the work of decision makers, practitioners, and academic researchers.

The demand for this type of training was great and it lead to the design and implementation of seven certificate programs in hazardous waste management. The program was initiated by Nicholas Hild in 1985 who lead the program until 1990. In 1990, William C. Blackman Jr. took over the program and received funding from the California-Arizona Consortium. The Consortium consisted of the University of California at Los Angeles, Irvine, Davis, and Berkeley; The University of Southern California; the Los Angeles Committee on Occupational Safety and Health; and Arizona State University. The participants were nonprofit organizations with extensive experience in hazardous waste management and in the conduct of hazardous waste worker health and safety programs. The original California Consortium was awarded a grant, in 1988, by the National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences to support a variety of low-cost hazardous waste worker courses. The Arizona State University's Center for Environmental Studies (now the Global Institute of Sustainability) was invited to join the Consortium and did so in 1990. The Center offered the courses required by 29 CFR 1910.120. The offered courses conformed to the curricula developed by the Consortium, as modified to meet Arizona requirements and regulations. When Dr. Blackman retired the program leadership was taken by Harold (Hal) Berkowitz and the classes continued to be conducted through the Center until 1999 when the program moved to the Arizona State University-Polytechnic campus.

Separability allows the decomposition of a household's expenditures into separate components that reveal income and substitution effects. Weak substitution provides the structure needed to describe the role of goods that are mitigating substitutes for pollutants. Our framework is general and offers a menu of separability restrictions that, when combined with weak substitution, achieve the same generic results but accommodate a wide range of problems. Our model encompasses separability attributed to household composition and decision scales (e.g. the collective model of the household, as well as joint modeling of physical effects (e.g. mortality and morbidity).</p>","Analyses of U.S. air quality regulations identify subpopulations that are particularly sensitive to the adverse health effects associated with air pollution on the basis of epidemiological studies of the physiological effects of pollution.

"427","An Assessment of the Effects of Crab Rationalization on Fleet Behavior, Input Usage, and Costs",NULL,"<p>The rationalization of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands crab fisheries has created a substantial need for economic analysis of the impacts of the program along many dimensions of the fishery. The cessation of the derby system has likely created considerable flexibility for vessel owners, skippers and other decision makers to alter many dimensions of their fishing effort to maximize the value of catch rather than to try to out-compete other vessels for the largest possible share of the TAC. In addition, unique features of the BSAI crab rationalization program - such as the availability of quota share for crew and the loosening of certain quota use restrictions for vessels participating in cooperatives - create additional incentives for decision makers to alter their behavior from the status quo. The margins along which these decisions may occur are numerous. At the micro-scale, rationalization may affect decisions of when and where to place gear in what quantities and the variable intensity of gear usage (e.g. ""soak time"") and what quantities/grades of crab to land or discard. At higher scales of decision making rationalization may affect the decision of when to leave port (with consideration of anticipated weather conditions) and the usage of fixed (capital inputs such as horsepower, hold capacity, etc.) and variable (fuel usage,
labor) inputs. Understanding the effects of rationalization on these operational decisions is critical to the larger scale assessment of the economic benefits and costs of rationalization and their distribution across sectors.

"428","Local Context and the Dynamics of Social-Ecological Systems: Beyond One-Size-Fits-All Solutions to Environmental Problems",NULL,"<p>Globalization is fundamentally changing the way humans interact with natural resources. Many people no longer rely on local resources but, rather, on a set of distant resources linked through a global economic network. Unfortunately, this integration of local resource systems across several temporal and spatial scales has the potential to amplify local resource degradation problems to the global scale. Sound management of the increasingly complex global resource system requires achieving a good fit both between local intuitions and local ecological contexts and local institutions and the global context in which they are embedded. This project will combine empirical case studies of local social-ecological systems from around the globe with the development and analysis of stylized dynamic mathematical models to begin to derive general principles concerning how to best achieve such a fit. Specifically, the project will address two overarching questions: 1) what local contextual social and ecological variables are most important in determining the success or failure of local resource management institutions and 2) how does the performance of local institutions change in response to changes in larger-scale processes associated with globalization.</p>

<p>The project's integrated research and teaching program directed at addressing these issues will contribute to both improved resource management and enhanced mathematical literacy. Evidence continues to mount that policies based on extremely simplified, theoretical models frequently fail. Using data to judiciously add complexity to basic theoretical models, this project will systematically explore the effects of local cultural, social, economic, and ecological context on the performance of institutions and management policies and identify to which external factors local institutions are most sensitive. This understanding will improve our capacity to diagnose resource management problems, build better solutions, prevent the loss of existing institutional diversity, and maintain the integrity of the global resource system upon which we all rely. At the same time, by immersing students in research at the boundaries between natural, social, and mathematical sciences, the project will help address our nation's challenges with low mathematical literacy.</p>

<p>Low mathematical literacy is due, in part, to the lack of interesting context in which to apply mathematical techniques for students outside physics, chemistry, and engineering. This project will provide such context through specially-designed courses and graduate research in which students will learn mathematics by using it to address problems in the social and life sciences that really matter to them.

"429","Agriculture, Water, and Institutions: Investigation of Water Management, Policy and Its Effect on Sustainable Water Use by Agriculture in Arizona",NULL,"The objective of this project is to evaluate the consequences of the 1980 Groundwater Management Act (GMA) for agricultural water conservation and the present-day viability of farming in the central Arizona desert. This project concerns the institutional and policy context in which farmers in Arizona's managed groundwater areas (called Active Management Areas, or AMAs) make decisions about water use. As demand rises for water in central Arizona, examining the rules pertaining to groundwater management allows for better insight to the incentives that either promote or impede sustainable water use in irrigated agriculture. Although restrictions were placed on irrigated agriculture with the passage of the GMA, such as a flat-out prohibition of its expansion in the five AMAs, preliminary research findings from a literature review of the GMA by this author suggest that the law might actually be buffering farmers from water stress, and, contrary to its original intention, encouraging them to maintain land in agricultural production, sometimes under unsustainable water use practices. The project will provide an initial policy recommendation on how current water policy might be revised to enhance all dimensions of agricultural sustainability in the Phoenix AMA, and will provide valuable input for the 4th management plan of the GMA.  As a new management plan is adopted every 10 years, the proposed research is important to understanding why some farmers adopt sustainable water use practices and why others do not.  Determining what factors encourage the conservation of water on irrigated farmland in the Phoenix AMA would be an invaluable contribution to better water management, and one step closer towards reaching the goals of sustainable agriculture.","This project seeks to interview farmers and water policy professionals, as well as review  available literature and public records to fill a gap that exists pertaining to how the Groundwater Management Act of 1980 has affected farmers' use of groundwater in irrigated agriculture in the Phoenix Active Management Area."

"446","A Longitudinal Analysis of the Social Dynamics of Environmental Equity in Baltimore",NULL,"<p>Through an interdisciplinary, longitudinal, intensive case study of Baltimore, the proposed research will identify the spatiotemporal dynamics of environmental-equity patterns and processes in a large, postindustrial city that has undergone profound socioeconomic change. The study will employ three key innovative methods that will yield results never before possible to discern. The first is a combined longitudinal analysis of outcome and process equity over the long term (1880 to present). The vast majority of environmental justice studies focus on outcome equity with only a cursory treatment of the processes that create those patterns. This study will systematically examine equity patterns and processes over the long term, using proximity to Toxics Release Inventory and heavy manufacturing sites as a disamenity and parks and greenspace as an amenity. The results will provide a robust, documented, and accessible dataset that will reveal much about relationships between population characteristics and amenities/disamenities, their changes over time, and the impact of the legacies of past dynamics on present patterns. Second, this study will be the first to integrate Geographically Weighted Regression with temporal analysis of equity patterns. This method will answer the fundamental question in environmental-justice research of whether environmental-equity patterns display spatial and temporal nonstationarity. Third, long-term data collection and analysis will permit an analysis of the social dynamics of environmental equity. With 120 years of data, the team will be able to test if there are global relationships between amenity/disamenity densities that relate to shifts in neighborhood characteristics. The longitudinal dataset also permits an analysis of temporal lags, to test if population characteristics change one or two decades after amenity/disamenity thresholds are reached.</p>
<p>This study will make substantial contributions to environmental-justice research, where longitudinal studies are rare, and those that are published usually span a single decade (1990-2000). A short-term analysis of environmental equity simply does not allow the type of analysis envisioned in this proposal, nor does it permit the kinds of tests that explain the underlying dynamics of environmental equity. A combined, long term, systematic analysis of outcome and process equity will be the first of its kind. The results of the research will yield new insights into the social dynamics of the urbanization process, particularly the social drivers of uneven and heterogeneous patterns that emerge over time.</p>","Through an interdisciplinary case study of Baltimore, the research will identify the spatiotemporal dynamics of environmental-equity patterns and processes in a large, postindustrial city that has undergone profound socioeconomic change."
"447","Heat Island Effect of Pavements",NULL,"<p>Rapid urbanization, which is transitioning native vegetation to man-made engineered surfaces, is taking place on a global scale. In 1950 approximately 30% of the world population lived in urban areas and, by 2030 that number is projected to be at 60%. As an example, by 2004, Phoenix had over 80% of Arizona residents residing in its urban area. Phoenix exploded in growth to become the nation's fifth largest city in population and larger in geographical terms than the City of Los Angeles. The added volume of paved surfaces and engineered materials during this time of growth has contributed to Phoenix experiencing one of the world's strongest Urban Heat Island effects (UHI) at a 0.86 dgrees F/decade-warming rate during the last century. As urban centers continue to expand and/or are being rehabilitated, there is a growing concern over local temperature increases due to solar absorption and associated heat emission. The problem is focused on the extensive network of dark colored horizontal structures (roofs and
pavements) in the built environment. These increases are exacerbated by the loss of vegetation and trees in and around our cities due to urban and suburban growth patterns and practices.</p>
<p>Since paved surfaces (streets, highways, and parking lots) comprise 29% to 45% of the urban fabric and the demand/climatic impacts of pavements will continue to increase, a combined research initiative comprising laboratory and field experimentation, and heat transfer modeling, needs to be undertaken.

"453","A Community-Driven Scientific Observations Network to achieve Interoperability of Environmental and Ecological Data",NULL,"<p>Advances in environmental science increasingly depend on information from multiple disciplines to tackle broader and more complex questions about the natural world. Such advances, however, are hindered by data heterogeneity, which impedes the ability of researchers to discover, interpret, and integrate relevant data that have been collected by others. A recent NSF-funded workshop on multi-disciplinary data management concluded that
interoperability can be significantly improved by better describing data at the level of observation and measurement, rather than the traditional focus at the level of the data set. That is, for systems to interoperate effectively, the scientific community must unify the various existing approaches for representing and describing observational data. A community-sanctioned, unified data model for observational data is thus needed to enable interoperability among existing data resources, which will in turn provide the necessary foundation to support cross-disciplinary synthetic research in the environmental sciences. The investigators propose the Scientific Observations Network to initiate a multi-disciplinary, community-driven effort to define and develop the necessary specifications and technologies to facilitate semantic interpretation and integration of observational data. The technological approaches will derive from recent advances in knowledge representation that have demonstrated practical utility in enhancing scientific communication and data interoperability within the genomics community. This effort will constitute a community of experts consisting of environmental science researchers, computer scientists, and information managers, to develop open-source, standards-based approaches to the semantic modeling of observational data. Subgroups of Network experts will also engage in extending this core data model to include a broad range of specific measurements collected by the representative set of disciplines, and a series of demonstration projects will illustrate the capabilities of the approaches to confederate data for reuse in broader and unanticipated contexts.</p>
<p>There is currently fragmentation among the environmental science subdisciplines, such that each is typically working to meet its own, internal data access and integration needs, without considering how data interoperability could be achieved more broadly through collaboration with researchers and technologists from other fields. By bringing together scientists from representative environmental disciplines, knowledge engineers and conceptual
modeling experts, and specialist information managers working within these domains, we hope to initiate a new crosscutting network to derive consensus on technology strategies for achieving data interoperability. This will be accomplished by retaining the momentum of prior NSF-funded activities that have identified a clear path forward for dealing with data interoperability, recommending that the broader community develop and ratify a unified model for scientific observation onto which current and future data models can be superimposed. Key to the success
of the proposed network will be outreach to the broader environmental science communities and stakeholders through a number of meetings and community-focused workshops. These activities will directly engage a diverse group of community members, allowing the broader community to contribute requirements and use cases, provide feedback on proposed approaches, and participate in community-building activities (such as ratification of a core data model).

"456","Neighborhood Ecosystems: Human-Climate Interactions in a Desert Metropolis",NULL,"This interdisciplinary research project explores human-ecosystem-climate interactions at the neighborhood scale in metropolitan Phoenix. The project draws upon social and ecological theories of spatial heterogeneity in cities in order to understand how urban development leads to economic, social, and physical inequalities among neighborhoods, which in turn produce neighborhood differences in microclimate conditions. Microclimate conditions influence the biotic environment, which then completes the cycle by influencing the socioeconomic and physical systems of neighborhoods. Because neighborhoods have unequal resources for responding to climate stress, socioeconomic status of the neighborhood and other local characteristics will moderate the effects of this process. The research has three specific objectives. First, the project will show how the settlement of neighborhoods between 1970 and 2000 transformed the landscape by altering land use, land cover, and climate. Second, the project will demonstrate whether and to what extent the resulting differences among neighborhood microclimates expose humans and other biota to unequal levels of climate-induced stressors, such as heat, poor air quality, and storm hazards. Third, the project will investigate the resilience of human and plant communities in neighborhoods that have unequal amounts of capital to cope with climate stress. The research sites are seven Phoenix neighborhoods located at monitoring sites of the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research project. <p>The neighborhoods, bounded by census block groups, included cases that varied by age, distance to urban center, land cover, income, and ethnic composition.The project used data from a wide variety of sources, including the census, social surveys of residents, historical land-use surveys and climate records, field measures of environmental conditions, and remotely sensed images of land cover and temperature. GIS mapping, graphing tools, spatial statistics, and multivariate statistical analysis were used to develop indicators of human, ecosystem, and climate activities and changes over time using. Using key indicators, neighborhood socioecological cycles were compared for places that differ by social class, physical features, and distance from the urban center. Research results were disseminated through publications in several disciplines and presentations at professional meetings.</p>

<p>Research on urban development in arid regions contributes to understanding the regional dimensions of global climate change. This project advanced the development of integrative theory in the social and ecological sciences by explaining how human actions influence climate change at the neighborhood scale. This is a necessary link between fine-scale ecosystem processes, such as variation in neighborhood microclimates, and coarse-scale environmental phenomena, such as global warming. The research helped improve models of urban growth and models of regional climate change. The project also informed human vulnerability theory, which explains how social inequalities expose poor people to higher risks of environmental hazards. While many studies of vulnerability focus on ""natural"" disasters that are more likely to harm poor people, this project studied chronic environmental conditions, specifically climatic variability and change, which poses a more lasting but less obvious threat to vulnerable populations. This project also provided opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to participate and learn about the interface between science and public issues as well as the conduct of interdisciplinary research.</p>","This research explored human-ecosystem-climate interactions at the neighborhood scale in metropolitan Phoenix, and drew upon social and ecological theories of spatial heterogeneity in cities to understand how urban development leads to economic, social, and physical inequalities among neighborhoods, which in turn produce neighborhood differences in microclimate conditions."
"457","Enabling the Study of Long-Term Human and Social Dynamics: A Cyberinfrastructure for Archaeology",NULL,"<p>Scientific investigations of change in socio-environmental systems are impaired by the lack of millennial- or centennial-scale data. In developing and testing explanatory models, we must do more than project recent observations&mdash;reflecting at most a few decades&mdash;into the past or future. Archaeology can provide the real-world, long-term data needed for such models and illuminate critical topics in demography, economy, and social stability. To date, efforts to recognize phenomena operating on large spatio-temporal scales have been crippled by the inherent complexities of archaeological data, the lack of data comparability across projects, and limited access to primary data. Indeed, scholars engaged in synthetic research rarely compare their data-driven interpretations with data recovered by other archaeological projects, but rather with the conclusions drawn by other researchers. Erroneous conclusions based on inconsistent premises become entrenched in the literature as ""facts"" that serve as faulty premises of subsequent scientific arguments. Nonetheless, the potential for archaeological insights to contribute to the study of long-term human and social dynamics is enormous; the fundamental challenge is to enable scientifically meaningful use of the expanding corpus of data. Internet publication of well-documented research databases alone would not solve these problems; issues of data comparability, complexity, and context remain.</p>
<p>To meet these challenges, a team of archaeologists, computer scientists, ecologists, and modelers designed and prototyped a knowledge-based archaeological data-integration system (KADIS) encompassing both new and legacy datasets. KADIS will provide scientific communities with concept-oriented, cross-project, Internet access to extensive social and environmental archives of primary data. Researchers will be able to extract a sensibly integrated and appropriately scaled database of analytically comparable observations from multiple datasets, gathered using incommensurate recording protocols. It will provide an open-source extensible foundation for a global, archaeological information infrastructure that will propel synthetic and comparative research to a new level and enable researchers across scientific disciplines to address large-scale and long-term questions with empirical support that has heretofore been unthinkable. The proposed work will lead to novel data representation and integration techniques applicable to diverse scientific domains in which data are inconsistently collected, many
inferential steps separate scientific understandings of major phenomena from observational data, and primary data are highly contextual.</p>
<p>A substantial number of graduate and undergraduate students were engaged in this multidisciplinary research. More broadly, this project has the potential to transform a key component of undergraduate education in archaeology. Using the proposed system, critical thinking exercises could easily employ large-scale research datasets instead of the artificial data often analyzed. KADIS will act as a research-, test-, and development-bed where Computer Science students can learn and experiment with various aspects of information integration and scientific data management.

There is little research to date that has systematically examined the effects of green building practices on home hazards, IEQ, and residents health; and none of this has focused on one of the most vulnerable populations: low-income elderly (or seniors), the target population of this study. While there are a number of research studies examining a single type of home features (e.g., home hazards) on singular health outcomes (e.g., injuries), none examine the impact of an array of green-building practices on prominent home health concerns of seniors, such as: respiratory ailments; joint and movement impairments; injuries; anxiety and other mental health conditions; and functional limitations.

"515","Land and Water Use Decision-Making and Ecosystem Services along a Southwestern Socio-Ecological Gradient",NULL,"<p>Understanding the socio-ecological dynamics of urban areas is limited by inadequate knowledge of the type, quantity, and quality of ecosystem services delivered in metropolitan regions and how actors incorporate considerations of ecosystem services and household preferences into management decisions. The principal question of this proposal is to understand how decision makers respond to and make land and water use decisions based on measured and preferred ecosystem services on the wildland-rural-urban fringe in the arid Southwest. We employ a comparative, gradient approach using the metropolitan areas of Las Cruces and Albuquerque, NM, and Phoenix, AZ, as case studies. Primary methods include stakeholder forums and focus groups with decision makers, hedonic modeling of houses prices and ecosystem service amenities, and biophysical modeling of ecosystem services.</p>
<p>By examining three cities along a population, economic, and physical extent gradient in an arid environment, this research will add to our knowledge about scaling in the urbanization process in a resource scarce environment. Choosing a southwestern regional context will provide greater insight into the urbanization processes in desert cities, which are underrepresented in urban theory. This research brings together individuals from the social and natural sciences accustomed to working in an interdisciplinary environment through the LTER and other networks. Many of the investigators helped author the LTER Decadal Plan and are enthusiastic supporters and leaders of a socio-ecological research agenda for understanding urban ecosystems. Valuable findings have resulted from a decade of examining metropolitan Phoenix as a coupled socio-ecological system. This research offers an opportunity to compare results with cities in arid environments, and will produce generalizable results and theory on the functioning of desert urban ecosystems.</p>
<p>Quantifying ecosystem services is an emerging science, and most of the models and results are based on humid temperate and non-urban ecosystems. Our research activities will add new data from arid urban environments for cities of different population sizes and extents which can be used to improve ecosystem service modeling. Another novel characteristic of this research is the combination of measured ecosystem services with ecosystem preferences, which typically are treated separately. Integrated knowledge of ecosystem services and preferences can improve the efficacy of land and water decision making. In an era when urban sustainability is increasingly important for guiding policy, this research will address this understudied but critical aspect of urban governance. The proposed activities will contribute important empirical data and a deeper understanding of the drivers, outcomes, and processes of land and water use, cover, and change. This will be fundamental for the long-term goal of understanding feedback relationships between land and water use, decision making, and ecosystem services.</p>
<p>This research will provide knowledge of ecosystem services and preferences to practitioners in arid urbanizing regions, which they can use to formulate and facilitate best management practices. Proposed interviews and stakeholder forums will give decision makers and citizen groups a voice in how land and water should be managed on the rapidly growing fringe. The proposed activities will also allow the research team to assess which ecosystem services and preferences are important to stakeholders so that future research can address those concerns. Best management practices that explicitly take into account ecosystem services and preferences will assist decision makers in meeting their sustainability goals. The activities and results will reach decision makers at the city, county, state, and federal levels, concerned citizen groups, real estate developers, and tribal groups. The proposed research has enormous potential for influencing land and water management in the Southwest. Through the proposed research, workshops, and meetings, graduate students will be trained in integrated, network-level socio-ecological research. Given the proposed activities and the partnership with the US Forest Service, graduate students will also be trained in mission-oriented research, an opportunity to translate science into results that meet critical societal goals. Students will benefit from the infrastructural support of the LTER network and the emerging ULTRA network. In addition to refereed journal articles, the team will leverage existing LTER infrastructure, including meeting support, data management, and communications expertise at site and network offices to disseminate findings from this research at regional and national conferences, in published papers, and through existing LTER web pages.</p>","The principal question of this proposal is to understand how decision makers respond to and make land and water use decisions based on measured and preferred ecosystem services on the wildland-rural-urban fringe in the arid Southwest."
"516","Urban Form and Energy Use Explored Through Dynamic Networked Infrastructure Model",NULL,"<p>Urban form, land use patterns, and the type of structures significantly influence a city's energy needs, and consequently, its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Engineering and design of urban form is an important strategy for managing climate change and other environmental impacts of energy, as well as being key to the livability of cities. This project aims to clarify connections between urban form and use and energy use in the built environment (buildings and paved surfaces) and transport. Specific research questions addressed are: 
<ul>
<li>How do different urban forms and patterns of land use contribute to energy use and GHG emissions? </li>
<li>How does urban energy use and GHG emissions evolve as a community changes over time? </li>
<li> How do socioeconomic characteristics of the population influence these patterns of land use and travel behavior together with their implications for energy and emissions?</li>
</ul>
These questions are addressed by building a networked infrastructure model which represents the life cycle energy use of buildings and transport by mapping energy use in travel analysis zones (TAZ) to a spatial network connected according to residents' travel between TAZs for different purposes. For example, retail building energy use for an area becomes a distributed network according to where residents are travelling for shopping trips. The model tracks dynamics through building a retrospective time series, through which the evolution of the network of energy use as an area develops can be tracked. The model accounts for life cycle impacts in that construction/manufacture, operation and end-of-life of buildings, roads and vehicles are included.</p> 
<p>The model is implemented through case studies of two Phoenix sub-areas, one in downtown Phoenix, which is undergoing redevelopment towards higher density housing and the second, a low-density suburban area at the edge of Phoenix which has undergone significant growth in the last two decades.</p>  
<p>The research proposes a new network model that integrates neighborhood growth, transportation, and life cycle assessment models to address questions of contemporary interest in urban infrastructure systems. The innovation proposed here is to view building infrastructures as a spatial network mediated through usage via transportation systems. In addition the proposal to study dynamics of the network through evolutionary longitudinal data could yield insights into urban system design. Longitudinal analysis has been rarely used in researching the impact of land use on travel behavior. While the modeling approach is explored through case studies in Phoenix, it can be broadly applied to urban areas around the world. The vision for this model is part of an evolutionary process to develop systems tools to better understand and manage the complexity of urban systems to enhance its sustainability.</p>
<p>The research engages research students, researchers and urban planners through a portfolio of outreach activities. An international partnership with the Technical University of Kaiserslautern, Germany, extends the international scope of impacts. Activities include development of a visualization tool, integration of material into university curricula and workshops that include urban planners and city leaders. To understand complex networks the project team will develop a visualization tool to enhance research and communication. At the university level, students are reached directly through incorporation into courses in the School of Sustainability and the School of Sustainable Engineering at Arizona State University. A broader group of students and faculty in the U.S. and abroad are reached through development of online modules and dissemination through the Center for Sustainable Engineering and the Technical University, Kaiserslautern, Germany. Urban planners and urban policy makers are engaged through workshops to be held in Phoenix and Kaiserslautern.</p>","Engineering and design of urban form is an important strategy for managing climate change and other environmental impacts of energy, as well as being key to the livability of cities.

"517","Assessing Decadal Climate Change Impacts on Urban Populations in the Southwestern USA",NULL,"<p>In the cities of the southwestern United States, regional warming combined with increasing urban populations and the resulting urban heat effect are straining limited supplies of electricity and water. Cities can be designed that are more resilient, minimizing human impacts and energy and water stresses, under scenarios of decadal warming trends. However, improved micro-scale climate models that resolve urban landscape hydrology, vegetation dynamics and patch-scale water and energy balances are needed to support the design of these resilient urban systems; funds are provided to create and validate a modeling system capable of resolving these dynamics. The tRIBS land surface hydrology model will be modified for urban environments and coupled with the vertically nested WRF 3.2 mesoscale and microclimate model. The combined model will be used to test the efficacy of different urban green-space and neighborhood designs under climate change scenarios with respect to the water and energy balance, demand for and optimal application of irrigation water, patch-scale air temperatures and humidities, and urban flooding responses.

"520","A Multi-Factor Analysis of the Emergence of a Specialist-Based Economy Among the Phoenix Basin Hohokam",NULL,"<p>Under the supervision of Dr. David R. Abbott, Sophia Kelly will analyze pottery provenance data gathered in her study of Hohokam ceramics in the Phoenix Basin, Arizona. The data will be used to examine the social and economic factors that contributed to widespread demand for specialized pottery production in this region during prehistory. The research has significance for several reasons. It provides insight into the mechanisms which facilitate effective societal functioning at a traditional level of development. It also provides insight into an important achievement in prehistoric America.</p>

<p>The prehistoric Hohokam economy provides an ideal case to evaluate the conditions associated with intensive pottery manufacture, because it was characterized by the widespread distribution of ceramic vessels fashioned by a relatively small number of people. For over 600 years, Hohokam households relied almost entirely on specialists to supply them with the pottery that they used to cook, serve, and store food. By the mid eleventh century AD, pottery producers in one geographic area manufactured almost all of the decorated containers used by more than 20,000 people across this vast region. This type of large and complex economy, which is typically associated with state-level societies, developed in the absence of clear political hierarchies. </p>
<p>Ms. Kelly's study builds a model that evaluates the role of four factors in the development of demand for specialist produced red-on-buff pottery in Hohokam settlements. The factors include 1) agricultural intensification in the form of irrigation agriculture, 2) increases in population density, 3) ritual or social obligations that require the production of particular craft items, and 4) improved efficiency of regional distribution systems. Demand for pottery produced by specialists is estimated through a ceramic sourcing analysis that determines the volume and concentration of non-local pottery at 14 Phoenix Basin settlements. The data generated from this project allow for a detailed reconstruction of the conditions that affect the organization of craft production over time and provide the basis to model these changes with unprecedented precision.</p> 

<p>This dissertation project is of value to researchers studying ancient economies, as well as to the contemporary ancestors of the Hohokam, the Akimel and Tohono O'odham. In order to extend the broader impact of her study, Kelly collaborated with the Gila River Indian Community (GRIC) to incorporate the tribes research interests in her project design. Mounting archaeological evidence that prehistoric Hohokam ceramic production and exchange were part of a complex, specialist economy is a source of interest and pride for present-day O'odham communities. This study is a timely complement to recent investment in tribal museums, educational programs on cultural resources on the reservation, and the establishment of a local Tribal Historic Preservation Office. In addition, the project involves the training of several GRIC staff members during the data collection process and a portion of the results will be co-authored with GRIC archaeologists. The data collected in this study will be made available through GRIC research databases, and interpretation of the results will be disseminated to the community through reports, presentations, and contributions to the local tribal museum (Huhugam Heritage Center). The databases from this project will be filed with the Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR).

"522","Analysis and Modeling of Traffic Instabilities in Congested Traffic",NULL,"<p>The primary objectives of this collaborative research study are to 1) better understand the interactive roles played by lane-changing and car-following, 2) quantify their effects on oscillations, and 3) develop a mathematical simulation model that accurately predicts the evolution of oscillations. Traffic oscillations are stop-and-go driving motions that arise in congested traffic. These oscillations propagate against traffic flow and typically grow as they propagate over space. They have long been thought and modeled strictly as a result of instabilities in car-following behavior. However, recent empirical studies have refined this long-accepted belief and suggest that lane-changing maneuvers are primary triggers for oscillations - formations and growths and that car-following effects further impact the growth of oscillations. The effects of lane-changing and car-following have been illustrated qualitatively and are yet to be quantified in detail. Microscopic analyses of individual vehicle behavior of lane-changing and car-following will be performed using high-resolution vehicle trajectory data that are made available by a recent development in data collection and processing techniques. Furthermore, this study will enhance understanding on the effects of heterogeneous traffic due to different vehicle classes and roadway characteristics on the evolutionary behavior of oscillations in space. The empirical findings will provide a framework to develop a simple, parsimonious model with physically meaningful parameters while incorporating the necessary factors. The model will be validated with empirical observation, which will be a rare contribution to the field of traffic theory. The outcome of this research will be a better understanding and a more effective traffic forecasting model of congested traffic.</p>

<p>This study addresses one of the key congestion-related problems deeply rooted in urban society. Oscillations have a negative impact on environment and safety, as they increase fuel consumption, emissions and driving discomfort. By providing a better understanding of the phenomena and a model to describe them, this study will likely prompt various researches in traffic flow and management strategies. Furthermore, the results from this study will promote development of better models for safety and environmental impacts which incorporate oscillatory driving. The research activities will be transferred through new courses which the Pis are currently developing as well as conventional venues such as journal publications and conferences.

"523","Adapting Law to Rapid Technological Change",NULL,"The pace of science and technology has greatly accelerated in recent decades, whereas the capability of regulatory frameworks to adapt to these changing technologies has, if anything, slowed down. The problem this creates is that our laws are increasingly out-of-date for regulating new technologies, and as this gap between technology and the law grows, so too does the likelihood of inadequate or inappropriate regulation of new technologies. Since it is unlikely to be feasible or perhaps even desirable to significantly slow the pace of science and technology, the only way to keep regulation up-to-date with technology is to speed up the adaptive capability of law and regulation. The goal of this project will therefore be to identify and evaluate new legal regulatory approaches that will be more adaptive and flexible to better keep pace with rapidly evolving technologies. The problems and limitations encountered by regulatory systems to keep pace with technology will be evaluated for six emerging technology case studies: (1) military robotics; (2) direct-to-consumer genetic testing; (3) nanotechnology health risks; (4) fMRI Lie Detection; (5) criminal activities in virtual worlds; and (6) surveillance technologies. Based on the shortcomings of present regulatory systems identified for these six emerging technologies, the project will develop and evaluate five new regulatory models to provide more adaptive oversight that are better able to keep pace with emerging technologies. The five regulatory models to be considered are provisionally identified in general terms as (1) real time adaptive management; (2) principles-based regulation; (3) collaborative voluntary programs; (4) framework agreements; and (5) institutional innovations such as cybercourts or independent commissions.

An integrated geological, geochemical, and paleobiological study of the Ediacaran Yangtze platform is aimed at improving our understanding of the interplay between ocean redox changes, geochemical anomalies, and early animal evolution in a rarely preserved, fossiliferous sedimentary archive. The proposed research is designed to test the following hypotheses: (1) the deep ocean was anoxic/euxinic until ca. 551 Ma; (2) episodic oxidation of a large oceanic dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reservoir led to the formation of geochemical anomalies including unusually negative carbon isotope excursions; and (3) the spatial and temporal distribution of Ediacaran organisms was coupled with ocean redox conditions. Objectives of the research are to determine: (1) carbonate and organic carbon isotope variability across the basin to test a potential surface-to-deep ocean carbon isotope gradient that may have been much greater than in the modern ocean; (2) spatial and temporal sulfur isotope variability to test the persistence and/or fluctuation of sulfate reduction and sulfur disproportionation across the basin; (3) spatial and temporal changes of molybdenum (Mo) concentrations and Mo isotopes, iron (Fe) speciation and Fe isotopes to determine the secular redox evolution and potential redox fluctuation associated with stable isotope excursions; and (4) spatial and temporal occurrences of Ediacaran fossils and their relationships with geochemical boundaries/anomalies.

"527","Examining the Evolution of Biospheric Oxygenation in Late Archean to Middle Proterozoic Oceans Through High-Resolution Trace Metal Chemostratigraphy",NULL,"<p>The project proposes to obtain high-resolution trace metal geochemical profiles from organic-rich sedimentary rocks to examine the evolution of climate and biospheric oxygenation in the Late Archean to Middle Proterozoic. The connections between climate and oxygenation are manifold. Oxygen levels in the deep sea are affected by the rate at which organic carbon is exported from productive surface waters, and hence ultimately from atmospheric CO2. In turn, enhanced burial of organic carbon in marine sediments can increase the O2 content of the atmosphere, with climatic consequences on an Archean Earth dependent on CH4 as a greenhouse gas. Oxygen levels also affect the ocean concentrations of trace nutrients such as Fe and Mo, potentially altering the vigor of marine surface biota and the efficiency of surface-to-deep carbon pumping. Earlier work by the Pis discovered traces of oxygenic photosynthesis and surface ocean oxygenation at least 50-100 M.y. before the first major rise of atmospheric O2 (2.45-2.32 Ga Great Oxidation Event; GOE). Their chemostratigraphic approach revealed an otherwise unrecognized history of biospheric oxygenation that is more complex than previously realized. Therefore, detailed investigation of this history allows them to test fundamental concepts that relate O2, carbon, micronutrients and climate. For example, can the same basic concepts developed to explain Holocene climate and carbon cycling explain conditions in the Archean and Proterozoic? The Pis propose to refine the timeline of biospheric oxygenation by developing an extensive compilation of trace metal concentrations for Late Archean to Middle Proterozoic rocks emphasizing key intervals straddling the GOE: the 2.7 Ga Joy Lake Sequence (Minnesota, U.S.A.), the 2.3 Ga Rooihoogte and Timeball Hill Formations (South Africa), and the 1.8-1.7 Ga Chuanlinggou Formation (North China). Trace metal geochemical profiles, when combined with sedimentary Fe geochemistry, can constrain the nature of local sedimentary conditions (e.g., bottom water redox state and basin restriction). Bottom water Mo concentrations in ancient oceans can be estimated by comparing Mo/TOC of these rock samples with sediment Mo/TOC and seawater concentrations in modern anoxic basins. For other trace metals whose marine geochemistry is less well understood, broad differences in metal marine budgets between time intervals can be made by comparison with Mo. The Mo isotope paleoredox proxy will be used to procure independent constraints on the extent of regional/global water column euxinia and assess the impact on trace metal abundances in seawater. Re-Os geochronology may provide precise depositional ages.</p> 

<p>The project will address four main questions:</p>

<p>1. How long is the time lag between the development of pervasive surface ocean oxygenation (and by inference oxygenic photosynthesis) and the GOE?</p> 

<p>2. What is the response of early Paleoproterozoic metal marine budgets to the GOE?</p> 

<p>3. Do metal marine budgets show temporal trends in the Middle Proterozoic related to increasing biospheric O2 and/or expansion of ocean euxinia?</p>

<p>4. What implications do such trends have for climate during the early Earth and how was microbial and eukaryotic ecology and evolution affected?</p>

"528","Development of Geochemical Proxies to Evaluate Larval pH-Exposure History",NULL,"<p>This project will develop a new interdisciplinary partnership between connectivity ecology (Levin at SIO), metal isotope geochemistry (Anbar and Gordon at ASU), and paleoclimatology (Herrmann at ASU) to identify new proxies for ocean acidification that can be used to assess pH exposures in living organisms and, potentially to interpret the geologic record. The investigators hypothesize that the isotopic composition of larval calcium carbonates reflects changes in seawater chemistry driven by ocean acidification and, in some instances, with associated decline in oxygen levels. The large extent to which these two parameters vary in concert in the modern and past ocean (and thus have joint influence), and the extent to which they may be uncoupled by anthropogenic CO2 inputs, merits considerable attention. Thus, the integration of pH and oxygen in proxy development would be an important advance.</p>

<p>The focus of this project is on proxy development to determine pH exposure history for living organisms in their larval state, and will center on calcium, boron, and uranium isotopes as well as multi-elemental fingerprints. For this project, the investigators will target open coast, front bay and backbay mytilid mussel species, each living naturally under a different pH regime, and statoliths of encapsulated market squid larvae from the open shelf. Larvae with known pH, oxygen and temperature exposure histories will be obtained from (1) laboratory larval rearing experiments that manipulate pH and oxygen and (2) in situ out planting of lab-spawned larvae in larval homes onto existing moorings where pH, T and oxygen are being monitored. Analyses will employ SIMS (for del 11B), multicollector (for del 44Ca, del 238 U), and laser ablation ICP-MS (targeting B, Cu, U, Pb, Mo, and a suite of additional pH- and redox-sensitive trace elements). Multivariate statistical tools will define ability to detect pH-induced signatures and to determine species or taxon-specific vital effects. The investigators are exploring proxies for invertebrate larvae that are untested in the context of acidification geochemistry. Targeting larvae is critical as many marine organisms produce larval carbonate structures and these stages may be most affected by ocean acidification. The retention of larval shell and statoliths after recruitment may ultimately allow us to test the importance of larval pH and O2 exposure to survival and population persistence.

One major source of Fe is the atmospheric transport and deposition of aerosols to the open ocean. The aerosols come from natural sources, such as soils and dust and biomass burning, and from anthropogenic emissions related to industrial processes and energy generation. Our understanding of the sources is limited by our ability to identify the origin of the Fe. Mechanisms of tracing the sources of aerosols include the use of the elemental ratios as specific sources have specific elemental signals.

<p>This project, a collaboration between investigators at Arizona State University and Northern Arizona University, will explore the use of Fe isotopes as a tracer of natural and anthropogenic sources of aerosols to assess their importance as a source of Fe to the open ocean. Fe is known to limit primary production in many high nutrient, low chlorophyll areas, so it is important to understand the origin of the Fe that is delivered to the oceans and its availability to marine microorganisms. Additionally, aerosols from different sources have variable size and solubility in seawater and therefore this also impacts Fe bioavailability.

"534","Atmospheric Processing of Iron &mdash; Does Particle Size Influence Iron Stability?",NULL,"<p>This project will examine the influence of particle size on atmospheric reactions of iron and, in turn, the influence of particle size on iron solubility. In particular, how particle size affects iron solubility during atmospheric processing by two different mechanisms will be investigated. First, the effect of particle size on iron solubility during photoreduction of iron in cloud waters will be determined. Photochemical reduction of aqueous iron has been well studied in authentic and simulated cloud waters, however, particle size has never been considered as a variable but may be important because only a restricted aerosol size fraction can form cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Previous laboratory studies focusing on particles too big or too small to act as CCN may under- or overestimate the soluble iron resulting from photochemistry in real atmospheric systems. Second, the influence of particle size on iron solubility during reaction with gaseous sulfur dioxide will be investigated. Exposure of iron phases mixed with sodium chloride will be studied at two relative humidities (20% and 80%) representative of dry continental and wet marine environments, respectively. This will allow determination of whether gas-particle or liquid-particle reactions are more important during iron-sulfur interactions. Following exposure to sulfur dioxide, the iron isotope composition of the dissolved iron fraction will be determined and used to elucidate mechanisms.</p>

<p>This research will be a valuable contribution to understanding iron solubility in continental and marine aerosols. The results will be relevant to the broader question of how atmospheric iron affects ocean productivity and, hence, its relation to the global carbon cycle. Iron is a limiting nutrient in many parts of the open ocean and substantial effort has been put forth to determine the availability of iron in atmospheric particulate matter to marine life. This study will also advance the training of the next generation of atmospheric scientists. The project will fund one Ph.D. student at Arizona State University (ASU), with this research being the core of his/her thesis work. In addition, one undergraduate student each year from Northern Arizona University (NAU) will work with the principal investigators and the Ph.D. student at ASU. The Department of Chemistry at NAU is a non-Ph.D. granting department. Therefore, collaboration with ASU researchers will provide undergraduate students at NAU training in research approaches and techniques that are not normally possible at NAU. Furthermore, NAU is among the national leaders in granting degrees to Native American students. These unique demographics will be drawn upon to recruit environmentally-focused Native American undergraduates through the Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals at NAU.</p>","This project will examine the influence of particle size on atmospheric reactions of iron and, in turn, the influence of particle size on iron solubility."
"535","In Search of Early Oxygen: Investigation of Redox Sensitive Metal Abundances and Isotopes in Neoarchean Drill Cores",NULL,"<p>This proposal will characterize element abundances and isotopes in two Neoarchean drill cores to investigate the oxidation state of the environment ~ 2.5 billion years ago. The goal is to determine if transient or low-level quantities of O 2 were present in the environment before the Great Oxidation Event (G.O.E.). The presence or absence of O 2 at this time has bearing on the relationship between the timing of the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and the rise of atmospheric O 2 &ndash; a relationship that will inform the eventual interpretation of spectra from extrasolar Earth-like planets.</p> 

<p>The proposed work builds directly on prior research on one of the two cores conducted by the PI, Co-I and others with support from the NASA Astrobiology program. In that study, summarized here, high-resolution chemostratigraphy revealed an episode of enrichment of the redox-sensitive transition metals Mo and Re in pyritic shales from the late Archean Mt. McRae Shale, Western Australia. Correlations with organic carbon and Re-Os data indicated these metals were derived from contemporaneous seawater. We proposed that Mo and Re were supplied to Archean oceans by oxidative weathering of crustal sulfide minerals and, hence, that small but significant amounts of O2 existed in the environment > 50 Ma before the start of the G.O.E. </p>

<p>We propose to conduct similar analyses on a drill core that samples pyritic shales from the late Archean Klein Naute Formation, S. Africa, believed to be a time-correlative deposit with the Mt. McRae Shale. We also propose to conduct Fe, Mo, U and S isotope analyses and to characterize sedimentary Fe speciation in both cores. The proposed research will test key aspects of the O 2 interpretation as well as alternative hypotheses, and will help determine if the event recorded in the Mt. McRae Shale was of local or global extent.</p>","This proposal will characterize element abundances and isotopes in two Neoarchean drill cores to investigate the oxidation state of the environment ~ 2.5 billion years ago."
"536","Determinants of Grassland Dynamics in Tibetan Highlands: Livestock, Wildlife, and the Culture and Political Economy of Pastoralism",NULL,"<p>Grassland degradation is a global concern, affecting not only wild species and pastoralists who rely on healthy grasslands for their survival, but also non-local people who suffer from resultant hydrological disturbances, dust storms, commodity scarcity, and social consequences of uprooted people. Livestock grazing is the dominant form of land use in Central Asia, and pastures of the Tibetan highlands are located upstream and upwind of roughly 40 percent of the world's human population. Grasslands on the Tibetan plateau usually are described as increasingly degraded. Causes for this grassland degradation are variously attributed to over-stocking of livestock, poor livestock management, historical-cultural factors, alteration of land-tenure arrangements, rapid changes in socioeconomic systems, climate change, and excessive herbivory and soil disturbance from wildlife. Prior research has yet to provide clear support for any putative causative agents, however, and previous studies have not examined interactions and complexity among these factors. As a result, policy choices to reduce or reverse grassland degradation often are made without a clear rationale and are based more on prejudice or convenience than evidence of their effectiveness. This interdisciplinary project will examine multiple correlates of grassland status and trends simultaneously, using replicated measurements at permanent plots in a multi-strata design, measuring the strength of evidence for various competing hypotheses. The investigators will link ecological measurements directly to current and recent historical actions by pastoralists, which in turn are affected by cultural norms, economic incentives, and policies of central and provincial governments. In addition to biophysical attributes of each site, livestock density and pasture usage patterns will be quantified. Each site also will be described by the particular grazing strategy employed by the pastoralist managing it, and that strategy, in turn, will be related to the complex of economic and policy incentives and historical determinants that pastoralists face. These data will be used to develop models that link broad historical, policy, economic, and cultural factors to local grassland conditions as mediated by the agency of individual pastoralists. The models can also be used to evaluate the implications of different policy interventions.</p>

<p>This project will deepen basic understanding of the complex interactions involving geophysical, biological, social, and policy factors and feedback systems that affect grassland status. Because multiple factors affect grasslands simultaneously and interactions are critical, the interdisciplinary, the systems-approach adopted by this project is fundamental. Enhanced understanding of this socioecological system will provide important input for policies on grassland restoration, biodiversity, and economic development in arid ecosystems worldwide. In addition to the education and training of students, the project will train a number of Tibetan field assistants, and the researchers will coordinate their work closely with local and provincial grassland and forestry officials. Direct collaboration with Chinese scientists and officials as well as facilitated workshops will enable research results to be understood by policy makers. Direct interactions with local pastoralists will allow immediate, practical applications of project results.

This work addresses the following VOCALS hypotheses: 1) Variability in aerosol properties impacts the formation of drizzle in stratocumulus clouds over the SEP, 2) The small aerosol radii over the SEP are primarily controlled by anthropogenic, rather than natural, aerosol production, and entrainment of polluted air from the lower free troposphere is an important source of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), and 3) Ocean upwelling affects aerosol precursor gases and the aerosol size distribution in the atmospheric boundary layer over the SEP. To explore these hypotheses, the size and chemical composition of residual nuclei in cloud droplets will be measured following sampling with a counterflow virtual impactor (CVI), which separates droplets from interstitial aerosol and evaporates them. Aerosols outside of clouds will be sampled with an impactor. Filter and impactor samples of residual nuclei and ambient aerosol will be analyzed by electron microscopy with X-ray analysis. These data will be combined with cloud microphysical measurements to determine aerosol effects on cloud optical properties and lifetimes and the characteristics of aerosol particles that nucleate cloud droplets. Nuclei of larger droplets, which initiate drizzle production, will also be explored. These measurements will complement observations being made by other investigators in VOCALS.</p>

"541","Experimental and Computational Studies on CO2 Photoreduction to Fuels by Nanostructured Catalysts",NULL,"<p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) from the atmosphere is a potentially sustainable source of carbon for the production of renewable fuels. The photocatalytic conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> and water to hydrocarbons is a particularly attractive route, as it uses solar energy as the source of reducing electrons to drive this conversion process. However, the photocatalytic reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> is an extremely challenging task due to the stable thermodynamic properties of CO<sub>2</sub>. The low yield of CO<sub>2</sub> conversion calls for more efficient photocatalysts, but the development of efficient photocatalysts requires understanding of CO<sub>2</sub> catalyst interactions and electron transfer pathways deduced from computational studies at the molecular level. The overall objective of the proposed research is to use solar radiation to photocatalytically reduce CO<sub>2</sub> to fuels (CO, methane, methanol, and other hydrocarbons) at high conversion efficiency through manipulation of catalyst composition and nanostructure. Toward this end, the proposed research has three objectives. The first objective is to fabricate nanostructured photocatalysts, specifically brookite-containing mixed-phase TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles with controlled phase contents such as lattice-doped iodine and surface Cu clusters, to achieve visible light responsiveness and facilitate charge separation. The second objective is to develop a fundamental understanding of the catalyst properties and charge separation mechanism at the mixed-phase (e.g., anatase-brookite) nanocrystalline interfaces through closely coupled experiments and computational chemistry (density functional theory) modeling. The third objective is to optimize catalyst composition and nanostructure (e.g., TiO<sub>2</sub> phase composition, crystal size, surface structures, dopant concentration, etc.) to synergistically improve CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction efficiency. In this regard, the proposed research will integrate experimental and computational approaches to evaluate brookite-based catalyst activity toward CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction, and will advance fundamental understanding in the multidisciplinary areas of material science, surface chemistry, photocatalysis, and nanotechnology. </p>

In the foreseeable future, GIS software will continue to play essential roles for breaking through scientific challenges in numerous fields and improving decision-making practices with broad societal impacts. However, fulfilling such roles is increasingly dependent on the ability to handle very large spatiotemporal data sets and complex analysis software based on synthesizing computational and spatial thinking enabled by cyberinfrastructure, which conventional GIS-based software approaches do not provide. This project will establish CyberGIS as a fundamentally new software framework comprising a seamless integration of cyberinfrastructure, GIS, and spatial analysis/modeling capabilities.

<p>The often non-linear, non-intuitive, and even surprising relationships and consequences that emerge from complex interactions between human social practice and the biophysical environment make it imperative that scientific models - including their underlying assumptions, algorithmic processes, logical consistency, and connections with empirical data - be transparent and quantitative.

"546","The Archaeology of Local Human Response to a Global Environmental Transformation",NULL,"<p>This project is a case study designed to identify the dynamics of local subsistence adaptations to the climate-induced environmental transformation of the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Set in the Mediterranean region of southeast Spain, it includes two systematic archaeological surveys and the geochemical analysis of stone tools collected during the past decade of archaeological research in the study area. The surveys sample the sources of raw material, from which stone tools were made, along three natural corridors connecting major ecological zones from the Mediterranean coast through the mountains to Spain's interior plain and establish the archaeological presence or absence of late Pleistocene human groups where the natural corridors intersect the interior plain. Each survey is the first of its kind in the region. Two previous pilot projects leading to the current dissertation project have helped pioneer the use of Proton Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) analysis to produce quantifiable geochemical signatures from stone tools and the raw material used to make them. Geochemical signatures are used here to link archaeological sites on a chronological scale, to track the movement and land-use patterns of human groups, and to establish the economic territories of groups with access to specific raw material sources.</p>

<p>The Pleistocene-Holocene transition is the only previous global environmental transformation confronted by modern humans - making it the best available analog for understanding potential human reactions to future climate change. However, late Pleistocene archaeological records in most of Europe are dominated by the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), which forced major shifts in demography. Human populations abandoned continental Europe west of the Ural Mountains at the LGM and packed into defined refugium areas. As the ice receded, and the Pleistocene began its transition to the Holocene climate regimes in which we now live, refugia populations dispersed outward and recolonized Europe. Mediterranean Spain was an exception, where the interval between late Pleistocene and early Holocene remained a relative continuum. For example, no territory in the study area was excluded from the subsistence base by glaciation. Changes in land-use can be considered responses to the ecological aspects of climate transformation and not simply a response to newly available land. As a result, Mediterranean Spain is a natural venue for studying the ecodynamics of human adaptation to the Pleistocene-Holocene transition.</p>

<p>Resilience in subsistence adaptations is a function of access to sufficient resources. Viewed from this perspective, late Pleistocene and early Holocene hunter-gatherer subsistence economies balanced a set of variables roughly analogous to those of local subsistence economies in climate-sensitive developing nations today. Exponential changes in population density between the Holocene and now redefine what is sufficient, as differences in technology modify the degree and pathways of access, but neither alters the fundamental relationships. An archaeological perspective allows a better understanding of ultimate, rather than proximate, causes of social and ecological system resilience - and that is the broader impact of this research. It recognizes global climate transformation as a challenge that local human groups have previously confronted, and it creates a conceptual framework within which to examine the decision-making processes and that allowed them to adapt in a world of unprecedented change.</p>","This project is a case study designed to identify the dynamics of local subsistence adaptations to the climate-induced environmental transformation of the Pleistocene-Holocene transition."

<p>To support these services, several specific tasks, including representation of the personal activity context, context-aware ranking, filtering, and previews, and integration of context and collaborative filtering are being accomplished. As an integrated service, MiNC operates on existing NSDL digital collection resources as well as on materials from other sites and repositories through available standard interfaces. For accessing NSDL resources, it leverages existing Open Archives Initiative (OAI) based protocols, available web service interfaces based on the Concept Space Interchange Protocol (CSIP), CSIP-Adaptable (CSIP-A) services as well as available NSDL Data Repository APIs. MiNC also integrates with other services, such as IntegraL.

Consequently, most existing solutions rely on a one-size-fits-all approach, where the data are integrated upfront and then the integrated data or knowledge-bases are used as is. Such snapshot-based integration solutions, however, cannot be effectively applied when the data sources are autonomous and dynamic or when, as in most scientific and decision making applications, assumptions, beliefs, and knowledge of the domain experts are indispensable to the integration process.</p>

<p>The proposed work tackles the computational challenges underlying a user driven integration (UDI) system, keeping in mind the human constraints and challenges that underlie the technical considerations. The key technical and intellectual impacts are in algorithms and data structures that can help bridge the semantic gap between the expert user and the system through a user-driven integration process based on individual user feedback. The team will specifically investigate (a) continuously revisable data/metadata alignment through vector space embeddings and probabilistic and generative models and (b) algorithms for query processing and candidate enumeration to support feedback over graph-based models of data with alternative interpretations.</p>

<p>UDI has potential applications to many domains (such as science and business intelligence) that need user-driven integration to answer key questions over diverse data sets. In particular,UDI will be incorporated into the NSF-funded tDAR (the Digital Archaeological Record), which has the potential to transform archaeology?s scientific endeavors by enormously advancing the capacity for synthetic research. The investigation of fundamental information integration challenges will thus contribute substantially to a shared infrastructure of science and will enable crucial transdisciplinary research concerning complex systems.</p>

A primary focus of the work is web services workflow-related issues. It has become increasingly difficult to build services-based systems that can effectively achieve distributed services composition and coordination in increasingly dynamic, uncertain and error-prone open system environments. The research will develop one model which can provide a means for specifying the interactive behavior of the underlying services to align their capabilities according to the requirements of their owners and consumers.

The research will contribute to unraveling the role of some brain peptides in the control of seasonality and how the brain expression of these peptides is influenced by specific environmental factors. The findings will be relevant to our understanding of the bases of reproductive resilience and they will enhance our comprehension of the effects of some environmental perturbations, such as those potentially associated with global climate warming, on the reproductive physiology of vertebrate populations. The experimental model for the research will be a songbird. Many birds are conspicuous and birds in general are inherently fascinating to the general public. The studies will, therefore, be used to promote basic and advanced biological concepts related to how animals may adapt to the effects of global climate warming and other anthropogenic perturbations of their natural environments. Experimental data will be made publicly available through the Ask-a-Biologist web site, a wildly popular site that promotes science education at all levels, but in particular in high schools.

<p>(1) Can self-assembled DNA scaffolds be used to self-assemble complex photonic and electronic structures? </p><p>(2) Can parts of the scaffold itself be used as active components of such assemblies?</p>

<p>Self-assembled DNA nanostructures based on Watson-Crick base-pairing (and the assembly of three-way junctions) are made simply by mixing together component DNA sequences and annealing the mix. Large (mm-scale) arrays of nanometer-scale motifs have been reported. Such arrays can be made addressable, and can incorporate chemical function and optical elements, opening up new possibilities for building electronic, photonic and chemical devices. Designed appropriately, the cost of arrays that cover surfaces can be quite small, perhaps a few dollars per square meter of surface covered. This grant focuses on renewable energy. The scaffolds could position quantum dots, photonic antennas, catalysts for light-driven hydrogen generation or conducting polymers for rationally-designed photovoltaics. One type of array will incorporate antenna structures that concentrate light on molecules that separate charge. The goal is to absorb all incident sunlight in just a monolayer of dye molecules, which would greatly simplify the design of molecular photovolataic devices. </p>

To date however, life cycle analysis research and supply network research have remained unlinked. The goal of this study is to address the research question: Do different configurations of a product's supply network yield different environmental performance? We posit that the different configurations of supply networks cause more or less work to be coordinated, yield different exposure to externalities, and different patterns of product and information flow. These mid-level effects lead to more or less economies of scale in resource usage and transportation, thus impacting environmental performance. This research explores these ideas using both modeling of large-scale databases and case studies of agricultural supply networks.</p>

<p>The practice of life cycle analysis is a common practice in industry, yet it has not been used to study the issue of process choice in manufacturing strategy. This work fills a void in the academic literature by proposing a theory of how the structure of a product's technology network might impact its environmental performance. This is the first study to empirically test the link between process structure and sustainability.

"559","Robust Theoretical Frameworks for Ecological Dynamics Subject to Stoichiometric Constraints",NULL,"<p>Organisms are composed of chemical elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Research in the area known as ecological stoichiometry (ES) has highlighted the ecological importance of the relative abundance of chemical constituents, known to vary considerably among species and across trophic levels. ES deals with how the balance of energy and elements affect and are affected by organisms and their interactions in ecosystems. It has proven to be an important new lens through which to view and understand ecological interactions and has gained momentum by explicitly linking the elemental physiology of organisms to their food web interactions and ecosystem function. Thus, ES theory covers multiple biological scales and allows, via rigid physical and chemical constraints, the construction of robust mechanistic and predictive mathematical models. While biology has a research tradition that is empirical in nature and often only weakly connected to formal quantitative analyses, mathematical and theoretical biology on the other hand has had a research agenda that has often been somewhat distanced from mainstream empirical biology. There is not enough effort and attention on marrying empirical results with theoretical findings. The investigators will extend and generalize existing well-received stoichiometry-based mathematical models to encompass a broader range of ecological situations, including cell quota dynamics, consumer age- or size-structures, variable consumer stoichiometry, and delayed nutrient cycling. Once such a generalized theoretical framework is established, the investigators will construct and evaluate models inspired by recent empirical discoveries in ES, including one considering the effects on consumer dynamics of not only insufficient food nutrient content but also of excess food nutrient content, and another considering the effects of stoichiometric dietary mixing. Finally, the investigators will challenge these parameterized stoichiometric models against observed population growth dynamics qualitatively and quantitatively. In doing so, the investigators hope to achieve a far-reaching synthesis between model and experiment in the form of new theoretical applications that may allow for direct and quantitative predictions of the effects of stoichiometric constraints on ecosystem processes. The models the investigators will investigate may motivate challenging but tractable problems in areas of qualitative and computational studies of nonlinear differential equations and delay differential equations. </p>

Merging the stress monitoring capability with the UHV-STM and a small deposition source will allow real-time measurements of the evolution of stress and structure. Experiments will examine stress and structure evolution during deposition of a range of transition-metal systems, including Ag/Pt(111), Cu/Au(111), and Ag/Au(111). Other experiments will include depositing films on reconstructed surfaces such as the Au(111) (p x 3 )-reconstruction to examine the role of ordered interface defects on the stress-structure relationship. In addition, alloy substrates will be used in order to decouple the effects of chemistry and epitaxial strain on stress and structure evolution in the ultra-thin film regime. The computational work will involve both Embedded Atom Method molecular dynamics (EAMMD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

It will study the diode performance and design interaction with the nanowire characteristics while addressing processing challenges. Arrays of such diodes have applications ranging from select devices for crosspoint memories to optical sensing and energy scavenging. The approach is based on bottom-up fabrication of vertical Si, Ge, and Si/Ge heterostructure nanowires grown with in-situ doping.

<p>The broader impacts of this research lie in its educational component and the potential value to the electronics industry. The opportunity for the student to work with researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies is especially valuable.

"568","Multi-Scale Particle-Based Simulation of Disordered/Ordered Interfaces for High Efficiency Solar Cells",NULL,"<p>The cost of solar cells must be reduced by a factor of two in order to achieve grid parity. There are a number of new technologies which can achieve this goal, including advanced silicon, thin film (CdTe or CIGS), organic solar cells, or, in the longer term, nanostructured photovoltaics. A commonality among these systems is the predominance of transport mechanisms across disordered/ordered interfaces that control the device performance. Existing modeling programs and approaches do not model such effects, requiring a particle-based approach such as Monte-Carlo modeling, which can accommodate hopping transport, recombination, and opto-electronic processes. In addition, the calculations are complicated by the long time scales required for photovoltaic applications, making a multiscale approach essential. The goal of this project is to develop a novel modeling approach to simulating and understanding materials and interfaces where ""hopping"" transport controls the transport and recombination, and then experimentally verify and demonstrate the ability to match and predict behavior of novel solar cells. The research will optimize two specific experimental systems (a-Si/Si and organic/Si) and demonstrate the ability to achieve both transport and low recombination across such interfaces. Future goals are to use the tool for other solar cell approaches and materials.</p>

<p>The proposal has several scientific novelties as its intellectual merits. One scientific advance is the development of a multi-scale particle-based, Monte Carlo approach suitable for modeling disordered/ordered material interfaces. The improved understanding of these interfaces will be used to develop a match between simulated and experimental minority carrier lifetime curves of a-S/Si and organic/Si interfaces, and then develop optimized solar cells based on these interfaces. In addition to new models, the final scientific advances are to identify approaches to controlling the interface and demonstration of improved solar cells using this understanding, and allowing development of novel solar cell structures. </p>

<p>The project has substantial broader impacts. First, it addresses a limiting issue for a range of novel solar cell approaches, from existing commercial devices to novel nanostructured, organic or dye-sensitized devices, allowing new, higher efficiency and lower cost photovoltaic approaches. In addition, it will provide unique educational opportunities beyond the research training afforded to the graduate student involved with the project. The collaboration of different groups will be formalized through a class on photovoltaics, which combines the viewpoints and expertise of the different groups. The collaboration will result in a ?simplified? Monte Carlo simulator that allows visualization of the transport in such complex structures. It will be added to the existing photovoltaic educational website developed by the Pis, which attracts about 1,000 visits a day. </p>","The goal of this project is to develop a novel modeling approach to simulating and understanding materials and interfaces."

"570","Modeling Heating Effects in Low-Power Multi-Gate SOI Devices and High-Power GaN HEMTs",NULL,"<p>Since scaling of conventional semiconductor devices will ultimately reach its limits due to both high production cost and device reliability issues, alternatives to classical metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) are being sought. There are two ways one can achieve enhanced device performance: (1) by using alternative materials such as strained-Si, SiGe, GaN, etc.; and (2) by using alternative device geometries.</p>

<p>Fully-depleted silicon on insulator (SOI), dual gate and FinFET devices are examples of al-ternative device technologies. Since the active silicon film in these structures is placed on top of a buried insulator layer, the power dissipation due to the substrate leakage current is eliminated. However, the buried oxide layer (which has a thermal conductivity about 100 times smaller than bulk Si) is a tremendous barrier to heat conduction, and degradation of the carrier mobility in the channel region of these devices occurs due to self-heating effects. In addition to silicon on insula-tor low power devices, heating is also a problem in high power wide-bandgap GaN HEMTs due to the large operation biases. The understanding of self-heating in these device structures can also shed light on their reliability, namely the phenomenon of current collapse due to the formation of cracks at the gate-drain end of the channel due to large electric fields and high lattice temperatures.</p>

<p>Therefore, the purpose of this project is to develop sophisticated particle-based device simulation tools that simultaneously take into account self-heating effects by solving the Boltzmann transport equations (BTEs) for both electrons and phonons, and considering quantum confine-ment effects for both the electrons and the phonons.

Urbanization is strongly linked to increasing temperatures through the formation of ""heat islands"" - places with higher temperatures due to radiant heat from buildings, concrete, and other human activities. Such local effects are likely to intensify with future trends in global warming. Previous studies have shown that the urban poor are most vulnerable to extreme heat, but little is known about the interplay between changing urban climates and the coupled human-natural systems that amplify or mitigate climate-related hazards for different socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups at finer spatial scales of neighborhoods and households. Taking account of global trends in urban growth and climate change, this project investigates the causes of variation in heat-related human vulnerability within the metropolitan region of Phoenix, Arizona. An ideal laboratory for this research, Phoenix has a naturally hot, arid climate. Rapid urbanization has increased average summer nighttime temperature by five degrees Celsius during the past 50 years. The research will explain the character of complex urban heat ""riskscapes,"" assess the vulnerability of people in different neighborhoods to heat-related health hazards, and identify the causes of variation of vulnerability within cities. Ecological, meteorological, sociological, and medical treatment data will be used to build an integrated system dynamics model of vulnerability to climate change that incorporates substantial feedback mechanisms from human adaptations. Researchers will use the model to test hypotheses about complex interactions between human manipulation of the environment and induced climate response, to explore relationships between neighborhood and regional dynamics, and to forecast alternative future scenarios. The results will be used to devise alternative neighborhood landscapes and community coping mechanisms that can reduce vulnerability, and to design programs for teaching and learning about climate and health. Innovative methodological techniques used in this study are developing fine-scale, surface energy balance models for integrating and extending climate research over spatial and temporal scales; combining airborne and satellite remotely sensed data with a meteorological model nested in state-of-the-art global climate model output; conducting spatial analyses of heat riskscapes and heat-related illnesses; and community-participatory research on coping strategies in low-income and minority neighborhoods.</p>

<p>Meeting the challenges of sustainability in a rapidly urbanizing and warming world will depend on decisions that allow humans to control or adapt to rising urban temperatures. This project will identify community and demographic markers of high-risk environments that decision-makers can use to develop spatially informed early warning systems and heat-illness prevention programs. Model projections for the distribution of future heat-related vulnerabilities and human responses that impact particular places and population subgroups are important for cities on several continents because enlarging heat islands, higher temperatures, and associated adverse impacts on health are occurring globally. Model results will be displayed in a visualization environment that will allow stakeholders to examine alternative future vulnerability scenarios; this will make knowledge accessible to the community and promote better decision-making. Educational activities will be designed for low-income and minority populations, including the production of a children's magazine issue on ""people and climate"" that will reach thousands of households.

BANs have many diverse applications including sports health management, home-based health-care and post-operative care. Due to the sensitive nature of the data collected, securing BANs is important for privacy preservation and protecting the host from bodily harm. Traditional security methods require considerable setup efforts in terms of pre-deployment of cryptographic secrets (key distribution).

Around the world, governments and international donors seek not only for new and better ways to build adaptive capacity, but also to understand how capacities are shaped by current development policy and international aid investments. Defining and developing metrics for adaptive capacity, however, is challenging on both theoretical and practical grounds. This research responds to these challenges by studying policies designed to mitigate drought impacts in Ceara, Brazil, a state historically marked by severe and frequent droughts. Public investments fall into two main categories: those specific to reducing drought vulnerabilities and those directed towards more generic response capacities. The first category includes activities such as crop insurance and the provision of irrigation and drinking water through the development of hydrologic infrastructure. The second category includes investments in social and human development such as rural pensions, poverty reduction and education voucher programs. This research examines how the vulnerability of rainfed farm households to drought has changed through time as a function of both specific and generic government-led interventions. The research also explores how these two categories of interventions are related, both in terms of their relative importance in defining overall adaptive capacity, and in terms of how they may create synergies or be mutually conditioning.</p>

While some of these compounds are likely to be produced by other subsurface microbes, this works focuses on the large inventory of consumable organic compounds that comes from geochemical transformations of organic matter that take place as sediments are buried and exposed to elevated temperatures and pressures. Goals of the work are to examine, both theoretically and experimentally, chemical reactions that occur at temperatures and pressures greater than microbial life can withstand. These high temperature and pressure reactions produce organic solutes that are transported upward into the inhabited zones of the subsurface. The primary focus of the research is to determine how reactions between hot water and organic matter generate small organic compounds that ultimately feed the deep biosphere. Phase I focuses on hydrothermal experiments of well-known reactions that transform simple hydrocarbons into alcohols, ketones, and carboxylic acids at elevated temperatures and pressures. Phase II explores these same reactions, but in the context of a more realistic and thus complex geologic system that includes the clay minerals found in all organic rich sediments and sedimentary rocks. Most of these reactions have not been systematically studied under geologically realistic conditions.

This project will assess the distribution, composition and reactivity of terrestrial and riverine carbon along a sequence of well-characterized reservoirs in a single watershed.</p> 

<p>This CAREER project integrates hypothesis-driven biogeochemical research questions, state-of-the-art analytical approaches, and innovative teaching strategies to address three fundamental research elements: </p>

<p>1. Developing a regional carbon budget for the Colorado River System using a combination of field measurements and laboratory manipulation experiments.</p>

<p>2. Examining the composition, reactivity, and fate of dissolved and particulate organic carbon in the Colorado River System.</p>

<p>3. Enhancing learning outcomes for geoscience students through field-based teaching.
</p>
<p>Longitudinal water sampling, carbon characterization, and biogeochemical process studies, culminating in a carbon budget for each reservoir, will assess the trophic state of the river system and reveal new insights into the interactions among the biological and physico-chemical mechanisms that transform terrestrial and riverine carbon. The research and teaching will be integrated through inquiry-based student field-projects that address discrete questions complementary to the broader scientific objective; the students results will be integrated into classroom activities, enhancing science education for hundreds of other students. This project will provide undergraduate geoscientists the skills to address complex environmental problems by exposing them to field-based research at an early stage in their academic career. The Colorado river system provides a unique opportunity to study a large managed river, and the results of this work will provide insight for the biogeochemical mechanisms that support carbon cycling in contemporary river systems.</p>","This project will assess the distribution, composition and reactivity of terrestrial and riverine carbon along a sequence of well-characterized reservoirs in a single watershed."
"584","Post-6 Ma Tectonic Evolution of the Bhutan Himalaya",NULL,"<p>Despite the considerable amount of research conducted in collisional mountain belts over the past few decades, little consensus has been reached regarding the influence that climatic and tectonic processes have on the surface, or how these processes are intertwined. Recent studies in the central Himalaya - a well-studied, archetypal collisional mountain belt - have produced conflicting ideas regarding what is the most significant control on surface processes. Farther to the east, the Bhutan Himalaya have not been studied in much detail, but are often labeled as an outlier when compared to the classic Himalayan form and geology. However, the apparently anomalous features of Bhutan make it an excellent environment to test some of the outstanding hypotheses regarding the interplay of climate, tectonics and surface processes. Atypical high-elevation, but low-relief landscapes are perched above and surrounded by deeply incised canyons in the middle latitudes of Bhutan. This study explores the proposition that these landforms represent a pulse of erosion that is sweeping through Bhutan and progressively changing the relief. Such a pulse of erosion signals a change in either tectonics or climate, or both and the characteristics of transient landscapes, including especially patterns of erosion rate, provide a framework to determine what the drivers for the change are. This research project focuses on determining basin-averaged millennial-scale erosion rates from the concentration of cosmogenic radionuclides within river sands. The sampling strategy will cover a wide range of mean annual precipitation, river channel steepness and basin relief. By combining these erosion rates with constraints from low-temperature thermochronology data, the research team will be able to discriminate between climate and tectonic-driven models in Bhutan and test hypotheses regarding the relationships between climate, erosion rate, topography and tectonics that carry implications well beyond the Bhutan field site.</p>

<p>The active nature of the problem addressed in this research has ramifications for many societal concerns including: seismic hazards, landslide hazards, sedimentation, reservoir management, navigability, soil erosion, and response to climate change. These issues are at times painfully clear to those who live in or near active mountain ranges throughout the world. Bhutan, because of its complicated political history and access issues, is one of the most poorly understood regions of the Himalaya. The research team is working closely with the National Environmental Commission of Bhutan to share findings in a meaningful way that better informs decisions in land use management and hazard mitigation. In addition, this research tackles fundamental problems in the understanding of mountain building. Many of the classic models of mountain building in collisional settings make predictions about the relative timing of fault activity; however, these assumptions have been shown to fail in some areas. The broad sample collection scheme will allow examination of uplift patterns across Bhutan to determine if these classic models hold true. Very little is known about the history of fault activity in Bhutan and therefore, any information regarding the pattern of uplift is invaluable to the governing bodies of Bhutan, who determine hazard assessment and control building codes.</p>","Atypical high-elevation, but low-relief landscapes are perched above and surrounded by deeply incised canyons in the middle latitudes of Bhutan.

"585","Cloud and Fog Processing of Organic Matter",NULL,"<p>This project will investigate the fate of organic matter in a cloud/fog system. First, scavenging efficiencies of particulate organic matter by fogs and clouds will be determined and parameterized based on simple measurable quantities like cloud liquid water content and/or water soluble organic carbon fraction. Second, product and kinetic studies will be conducted to evaluate the potential for reactions within droplets that lead to the formation of secondary organic aerosol matter. Third, the homogeneous aqueous phase chemistry of selected organic species, namely, nitrosamines will be investigated. These can form in clouds during the nighttime. During the day, they are eliminated by cloud photolysis. Both formation and destruction kinetics will be studied in laboratory experiments. The results on benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) and nitrosamines will be evaluated against field experiments. This includes the partitioning of the target species in the cloud system, as well as, the concentrations of parent and daughter species. Results of the field work will be used to guide laboratory experiments, and identify any gaps in data. Finally, the project will involve multiple, routine cloud measurement sites complemented by intensive, short-term field studies in a variety of environments throughout the United States.</p>

Furthermore, undergraduate university institutions will be critical participants in achieving this project's scientific goals. Most of the routine environmental sampling will rely on the cooperation of non-PhD granting institutions at different locales. Students and faculty from these institutions will be crucial to the successful completion of the research goals through field sampling of cloud samples. These undergraduate students will be hosted at ASU to participate in sample analysis through internships. The same options will be made available to ASU undergraduate students, with particular attention given to recruiting through minority outreach programs.

The research will consider both the downscale influence of large-scale atmospheric conditions on urban-scale weather and climate, and the upscale influences of cities on the regions surrounding them. Upscale influences will be studied on a variety of spatial scales, from the effect of urban heat islands on the countryside downwind of a city to the aggregate effect of all urban areas on global climate. In the case of downscale influences, the goal is to develop models which explicitly represent the urban landscape, including the thermal, hydrological, and radiative properties of paved and built urban surfaces, and the surface drag exerted on the wind by ""street canyons"". Urban effects will be simulated by creating nested modeling systems, in which microscale models to represent urban areas are incorporated into mesoscale models which represent larger regions, which may be further incorporated into global models. Research on the upscale effects of urban areas will develop strategies to represent urban areas through ""parameterizations"", in which the net effects of urban landscapes are approximated in computationally tractable ways in global models with relatively coarse resolution.</p>

<p>The modeling capability developed in this project will directly benefit decision makers addressing issues relating to urban pollution, human comfort, and the effects of climate change on urban areas.

"591","Microbally Induced Cementation of Sands by Denitrification",NULL,"The research team investigates the use of oxidation of organic compounds by denitrifying bacteria (""denitrification"") to induce carbonate cementation in sand. Microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) offers the promise of a sustainable, non-disruptive and energy efficient engineering solution to a variety of important infrastructure development and geologic hazard mitigation problems, including remediation of liquefaction potential, improving foundation bearing capacity, and reducing (or even eliminating) excavation and tunnel support requirements. MICP through ureolysis is being investigated by several research groups in the U.S. and abroad. However, denitrification is potentially superior to ureolysis as a MICP process in that denitrifying bacteria are ubiquitous in the subsurface and the process works under anaerobic conditions, e.g. below the water table, while ureolysis requires oxygenation. Denitrifying bacteria and nutrients will be introduced into a laboratory soil column with pore water containing calcium carbonate in solution. Carbonate precipitation will be monitored by mass balance measurement of calcium concentrations in the pore fluid and the development of cementation will be monitored by shear wave velocity measurements in the soil column. These column experiments will be used to refine a biogeochemical model for denitrification, establish an optimal nutrient mix for denitrification, and establish precipitation and cementation rates for MICP by denitrification. Triaxial and simple shear tests on specimens from the column experiments will be used to evaluate the relationship between the amount of MICP and changes in the strength, stiffness, and liquefaction potential of the specimens. The proposed research has the potential to transform geotechnical practice, not only by development of a new, sustainable approach to ground improvement but also by advancing the emerging field of biogeotechnical engineering.

"592","The Integrity of Geosynthetic Elements of Waste Containment Barrier Systems Subject to Large Settlement and Seismic Loading",NULL,"<p>The objective of this project is to investigate the ability of modern landfill waste containment systems to maintain their integrity when subject to waste settlement, earthquake loading, and loads from operational practices. The researchers will also examine design strategies and details to mitigate these potential threats to containment system integrity. Landfills are an essential component of our nation's civil infrastructure. Modern landfills rely upon sophisticated engineered liner and cover systems composed of soil and geosynthetic (i.e., polymer) materials to contain the waste and waste by-products and thereby protect the environment. A breach of a landfill containment system can result in serious and costly environmental impacts. While it is widely recognized that waste settlement can apply stress to landfill liner and cover systems, the impact of the large waste settlement typically associated with solid waste landfills on the integrity of these systems is generally not considered in current design practice. The impact of seismic loading on containment system integrity is generally considered in a gross empirical fashion; however, current methods do not quantify the loads applied by a seismic event to the containment system. Furthermore, damage that does occur to liner and cover system elements may be hidden, with no surface expression to alert the engineer, operator, owner, or regulator to the problem. The objectives of this collaborative research project will be achieved through: 1) experimental measurement of the load-deformation behavior of key geosynthetic/geosynthetic and geosynthetic/soil interfaces, including their response under dynamic loading, 2) development of realistic computational models that describe the load-deformation behavior of these elements and interfaces, 3) numerical implementation of the computational models to predict the behavior of waste containment systems subject to waste settlement and seismic loads, and 4) application of the numerical method to typical landfill configurations to identify conditions that pose a threat to the integrity of landfill liner and cover systems and develop strategies for mitigating these conditions. </p>

<p>This project has the potential to transform the way landfills are designed in engineering practice. The research conducted on this project is expected to lead to improved procedures for evaluating the integrity of landfill liner and cover systems; more realistic design methods; enhanced confidence in the long term reliability of landfills; improved landfill construction procedures; and, improved product design for geosynthetics used in landfill construction. The societal benefits of more realistic and reliable waste containment system designs should not be underestimated. Moving away from the crude and largely unsubstantiated design criterion currently used in practice and toward a more rational methodology will be a major advance in landfill design and help to enhance public acceptance of and confidence in waste containment systems. This project, funded in part under the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) program, is a collaboration between two industry/academia teams: Ohio State University and CETCO (a leading geosynthetic manufacturer) and Arizona State University and Geosyntec Consultants (a leading geoenvironmental consulting firm).

"593","Fundamental Goals and Decision Making",NULL,"This multi-site research project examines how fundamental motives such as mating, self-protection, status-seeking, and affiliation influence basic cognitive processes such as perception and memory. Whether decisions which involve the allocation of critically important resources are influenced by fluctuations in fundamental motivations, such as self-protection, mating, or status concerns is of interest. These motivations frequently generate nonlinearities in decision making, and are themselves evoked by the dynamical interplay of chronic individual goals, ecological circumstances, and acute situational forces -- processes foundational to complexity science. The researchers propose a series of studies examining how fundamental motivations might alter the psychological functions underlying everyday decision-making. Specifically, they propose to conduct 20 conceptually related studies examining variation in decision-making as a function of shifting individuals' focus towards different fitness-relevant problems. Each experiment manipulates different fundamental motivations (such as status seeking, self-protection, kin care, disease avoidance, or mating), and examines the effects of such motivations on decisions about economic risks or trade-offs between different desirable economic and social outcomes. These motivations frequently generate nonlinearities in decision making, and are themselves evoked by the dynamical interplay of chronic individual goals, ecological circumstances, and acute situational forces. Studies 1-2 examine risk in financial investing; studies 3-8 explore discounting of future versus probabilistic benefits; studies 9-12 focus on financial loss aversion; studies 13-14 examine loss aversion to different social benefits; studies 15-16 examine budget allocation between different economic and social outcomes; and studies 17-20 examine budget allocation between different outcomes in micro- versus macroeconomic decisions. This work is influenced by theoretical developments at the interface of evolutionary biology, cognitive science, and social psychology, and has potential for broad theoretical advances with critical relevance to important everyday decisions.

"594","Microbial Ecology to Optimize Beneficial Syntrophies to Improve Microbial Electrochemical and Dechlorinating Systems",NULL,"<p>Organic wastes from agriculture, industrial wastewater treatment, and other feedstock can provide renewable sources for energy conversion or bioremediation via properly managed hydrolysis, fermentation, and respiration processes. The outputs of fermentation are organic acids, alcohols, and H2 or methane (CH4). Success or failure of any process where fermentation is necessary to break down a complex substrate for its further use in environmental processes, is determined by the fate of H2 and the organic acids. These fermentation products can be used as electron donors for microbial electrochemical and dechlorinating systems. However, acetate and H2 can also be converted to CH4, which becomes a sink of electrons. The efficiency of routing electrons to the ideal destination is usually determined by syntrophic interactions among the different microorganisms present in the system. To exploit organic wastes as sources of carbon and electrons for bioenergy and remediation, understanding the microbial ecology and, specifically, the syntrophic relationships that develop is critical for success. Here, the PI proposes to channel electron flow through acetogenesis by promoting good syntrophies with homoacetogenic bacteria. Proper homoacetogen management will allow the use of renewable feedstock to fulfill two critical societal needs: renewable-energy production and reclaiming contaminated water. The research will evaluate the central hypothesis that the performance of ARB and dechlorinators will be enhanced when they are part of a beneficial syntrophy with homoacetogens. The work on the two systems will be complementary. For example, the studies with the MXC systems will be especially valuable for characterizing electron flow in the communities that involve homoacetogens, since the fate of electrons delivered to the anode can be tracked with high precision in real time. Knowledge gathered from the MXC systems will be applied to understanding electron flow in dechlorinating systems. Likewise, genomics-based techniques developed to characterize and quantify key microbial groups in one system will be applicable to the other, since homoacetogens, fermenters, and methanogens are common to both.</p>

<p>The PI will evaluate practical strategies for promoting the positive microbial interactions in MXCs and dechlorinating systems. Two strategies to be tested include the use of high concentrations of NH4+ (e.g., as found in animal waste) and combinations of CO, CO2, and H2 (e.g., from synthesis gas). She will also characterize in detail the effect of these two strategies in promoting positive syntrophies that will lead to higher electron recoveries and dechlorination rates.</p>

<p>This research provides a novel approach to study biodegrading and bioenergy relevant mixed microbial communities. The results will provide fundamental understanding of the role of homoacetogens in electron and carbon flow in dechlorinating and ARB mixed communities. This will allow exploiting the use of complex renewable waste sources for bioenergy and bioremediation. The proposed research is transformative because it is the first comprehensive study which will take advantage of knowledge gathered from homoacetogenic microorganisms in two different systems in order to increase desired electron and carbon flows to beneficial microbial communities.</p>

<p>The research proposed will enhance energy and water sustainability. It will also directly impact the understanding of carbon and electron flow when organic wastes are used as sources of carbon and electrons in bioremediation and ARB microbial communities.

"595","Spatial Refueling Patterns of Drivers of Alternative-Fuel and Conventional Vehicles",NULL,"<p>Over the next several decades, countries transitioning from gasoline and diesel to alternative fuels will need to invest heavily in new refueling station infrastructures. Refueling stations will need to be located in places convenient for early adopters of alternative-fuel vehicles (AFVs). What constitutes ""convenience,"" however, has been a matter of debate. In particular, two groups of optimization models used to deploy new stations have taken divergent views of convenience. One group aims to minimize distance traveled from homes to stations, while the other locates stations ""on the way"" &ndash; on the routes people regularly travel from their origins to their destinations. Which approach best fits the actual behavior of AFV drivers is unknown, however. For insights into refueling behavior, researchers have looked to two studies from 1983 and 1984. Given the paucity of AFVs on the road at that time, these studies used diesel drivers as a proxy for the refueling patterns that early AFV drivers might exhibit given the relative scarcity of alternative-fuel stations. Patterns of refueling stations for contemporary alternate-fuel drivers are much sparser than the diesel-fuel networks of the 1980s, so new models are needed that are better suited to current conditions. This research project will survey drivers about their refueling patterns and behaviors to better understand the assumptions underlying the deployment of new stations. Drivers will be interviewed at stations while they refuel. The survey will ask for the geographic details of their current trip. Socioeconomic and demographic data will be gathered and drivers will be asked whether they detoured from their desired route, why they chose this station, and other questions. To investigate the effects of station site and situation, a number of AFV stations and a control group of gasoline stations will be sampled to represent a variety of geographic settings, including urban, suburban, interstate highways, and arterial streets. Geographic information system-based analyses will be used to measure distances from home, deviations from shortest paths, and geographic characteristics of station-service areas. </p>

<p>This project will improve understanding of evolving travel behavior for which past studies do not provide sufficient information or insights. Research conducted nearly 30 years ago will be updated and expanded to examine behaviors of actual alternative-fuel vehicle drivers. The project will contribute to the literatures on detouring behavior, distance decay, retail service areas, and adoption of AFVs, and it provide a much-needed empirical foundation to theoretical models for optimal station location. The project will contribute to wider-ranging efforts to combat global climate change and local air pollution by helping to overcome the foremost barrier to the use of alternate-fuel vehicles, namely the lack of a refueling infrastructure. Understanding where and when drivers refuel will enable industry to locate stations more efficiently. The U.S. will benefit by saving money on stations, increasing adoption of AFVs, reducing dependency on foreign oil, and developing green jobs and clean industries in the U.S. </p>","This research project will survey drivers about their refueling patterns and behaviors to better understand the assumptions underlying the deployment of new stations for alternative-fuel vehicles."

"599","Understanding Agents of Scientific Change: The Case of Embyro Research",NULL,"For the HSD initiative, Embryo research provides a case study of rapidly changing science within radically contested contexts. As with any science, embryo research is embedded in webs of unsettled ethical, legal, political, religious, cultural, and social negotiations that shape the conduct of science, its diverse meanings, and the spectrum of decisions built upon such understandings. Embryo research starts with a scientific drive to understand development of the individual organism and is shaped by three clusters of factors: (1) technical, including experimental techniques, equipment, and the way results are presented (in publications and presentations) and represented (in images and models); (2) actors, laboratory settings, institutions, and local contexts of scientific and technical work; and (3) social/cultural/ intellectual/economic environments in which the work is done. These clusters of Technical, Actors/Places, and Social/Cultural all impact and are impacted by the science. Understanding each requires different disciplinary research approaches, and understanding interactions requires multi-disciplinary research strategies and methods. The factors combine to serve as ""Agents of Change"" shaping science in society. This project explores those agents of scientific change in a dynamic, interactive, integrative, interdisciplinary, international research environment. With regards to Intellectual Merit, we will accomplish two major intellectual goals. First is a rich understanding of the history and current state of embryo research, the factors involved, and the multiple contexts in which research is done. Because of the importance of embryo research, this is of powerful intellectual value itself. Furthermore, in bringing together multiple otherwise disparate areas of study related to this particular case, we will achieve a much richer understanding of the Agents of Change influencing each case of scientific change. Our hypotheses focus on selected episodes in which different factors had different relative importance, and we seek to analyze and understand the Agents of Change over time. All results will be part of the digital working environment of the Virtual Laboratory (VL) in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin. We will archive research materials to be shared among different working teams, and will add scholarly interpretive essays and articles that will make up an on-line Resource Collection accessible to multiple users, in addition to traditional scholarly publications. With regards to Broader Impacts, this project has a several: (1) Working with a network of nearly 2 dozen collaborators in 6 countries and multiple disciplines, we will develop a true ""collaboratory."" By sharing materials and research questions, we will ask new questions within each discipline and learn of research materials, questions, and interpretations across disciplines. (2) The VL tested digital working environment makes that research possible by making all research materials and scholarly interpretations available to all users at all times. (3) The research will allow us to demonstrating how Agents of Change affect this case of Embryo Research in its societal contexts, including interpretations of the emerging patterns shaping science and societal decisions. This should also inform future decisions processes and policy-making. (4) In the final stages, we will develop Educational Materials for multiple user groups.

"600","A Machine Learning Approach to Computational Understanding of Skill Criteria in Surgical Training",NULL,"<p>A recent study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) documented over 32,000 mostly surgery-related deaths, costing nine billion dollars and accounting for 2.4 million extra days in hospital in 2000. At the same time, economic pressures influence medical schools to reduce the cost in training surgeons. The success of simulation-based surgical education and training will not only shorten the time involving a faculty surgeon in various stages of training (hence reducing cost), but also will improve the quality of training. Reviewing the state-of-the-art research, there are two research challenges: (1) to automatically rate the proficiency of a resident surgeon in simulation-based training, and (2) to associate skill ratings with correction procedures. This award will explore a machine-learning-based approach to computational understanding of surgical skills based on temporal inference of visual and motion-capture data from surgical simulation. The approach employs latent space analysis that exploits intrinsic correlations among multiple data sources of a surgical action. This learning approach is enabled by the simulation and data acquisition design that ensures clinical meaningfulness of the acquired data.</p> 

<p>The intellectual merit of the proposed work lies in the exploration of the answers to two key research questions: (1) how to develop a computational understanding of surgical-skill-defining criteria (high-level knowledge) from low-level, raw sensory observations; and (2) how to efficiently perform temporal inference from correlated data sources of disparate nature with unknown structures. Expertise related to motion is a well-observed phenomenon but the task of inferring motion expertise patterns from captured data especially video is largely unexplored. This award presents a controlled methodology to extract expertise patterns from raw sensory data. This interdisciplinary team with collaboration from medical professionals is well positioned to address these fundamental research issues.</p>

<p>The broad impact of the proposed work is threefold. First, the ability of the proposed system to create descriptive, mathematical models from recorded video and other data in surgical training opens up the possibility of new paradigms that can significantly improve current practice in surgeon education and training. Second, the proposed approaches may enable development of lower-cost surgical training systems. Third, the novel formulation of and solution to the fundamental problem of expertise inference from disparate temporal measurements with intrinsic correlation can find many other applications such as sports (e.g., baseball and golf training), rehabilitation, and surveillance. The impact of the interdisciplinary project on education manifests in its direct contribution to better training and education of surgeons and to nurturing a new generation of students who possesses strong interdisciplinary background and skills. </p>","This award will explore a machine-learning-based approach to computational understanding of surgical skills based on temporal inference of visual and motion-capture data from surgical simulation."

Feedback mechanisms, many of which are poorly understood, further complicate the picture. Because there is only one Earth, climate cannot be studied by systematic experimentation; the only approach available to climate researchers is through computational experiments. These experiments are based on mathematical models, which must be simple enough not to exceed the capabilities of today's advanced computer architectures, while still incorporating the physical and chemical processes that are essential for realistic climate outcomes. The expertise of mathematical scientists in designing, assessing and interpreting these models is critical.

"608","Materials World Network: Study at the Nanoscale of Photovoltaic Materials",NULL,"<p>This Materials World Network project is a collaboration of groups from Argentina, Canada, Mexico and the US with the common goal of synthesizing and characterizing, at the single molecule/particle level, semiconductor-photosensitizer materials that can be used for photovoltaic and solar-to-fuel applications. Electron injection by photosensitizers into semiconductor materials has been studied extensively, mostly by electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques based on conventional measurements of bulk materials. These studies often reveal electron transfer processes that are both thermodynamically and kinetically indicative of heterogeneity in the sensitizer-semiconductor material. To characterize such heterogeneity we are systematically studying the electron transfer processes using single molecule/particle techniques. If sub-populations of sensitizer-semiconductor particles of high efficiency can be identified, it should be possible to distinguish structural features that make it so and thus improve the sensitizer-semiconductor material interface and overall performance of photovoltaic devices.</p>

<p>A contribution of the US team is the synthesis of sensitizer-semiconductor nanoparticle models. Initially, we will work with systems consisting of perylene-TiO2 and perylene-SnO2. With the experimental techniques in hand, the aim is to develop tetrapyrrole-based semiconductor models, which upon excitation of the sensitizer in the visible range, inject electrons into the semiconductor conduction band and thereby generate high oxidation potential (> 1.30 V vs. NHE) sensitizer radicals. High potential is necessary to drive water oxidation. In parallel with these systems, we plan to develop materials for photoanodes having a highly reducing output, needed for the reduction of H+ to H2. Conventional and novel single molecule/particle fluorescence spectroscopy (SMFS) methods will be used to study photoinduced electron transfer processes within the sensitizer-semiconductor nanoparticle models. In particular, we seek to identify distributions of electron transfer efficiencies as a function of parameters such as sensitizer-semiconductor nanoparticle separation distance, type of linkage, geometry and assembly methodology. Another objective of the project is to study the role played by the occupation of the semiconductor energy levels in the photoinduced electron transfer process. The main technique in this case will be the newly developed single molecule/particle spectroelectrochemistry (SMS-EC). The electrochemical aspect of the technique will be used to control the population of the energy levels of the semiconductor particles, while the SMFS aspect will be used to monitor the redox state(s) of the sensitizer(s) in individual molecules by detecting their fluorescence.</p>

The monitoring and management of convicted offenders is a major policy consideration in the United States. Many federal and state regulations mandate that communities track those individuals who have been convicted of certain crimes, in some cases for their entire lives as they move from one location to another. Local jurisdictions have also extended these federally mandated requirements for convicted offenders with increasingly punitive ordinances that ban offenders from living within a specified distance of certain locations and imposing dispersion and saturation statutes that limit the number of offenders living within a community or local area. This collaborative research project will (1) develop a spatial analytical framework for addressing offender issues; (2) establish guidelines for the appropriate use and specification of methods to address a range of contexts, including inference and optimization approaches; (3) develop optimization models reflecting public policy, thereby enabling spatial impacts to be evaluated for alternative policy scenarios; (4) develop space-time methods for assessing offender residency change; and (5) interpret findings to better inform public policy and corrections practices with respect to legislative implications, community notification, and offender reentry.

Unfortunately, there exists little in the way of deep, data-based knowledge of the manner in which religion influences conflict processes. Such knowledge is critical for analyzing conflict situations, for being able to anticipate the emergence of conflict situations, and for creating policies to defuse potential conflicts or better manage existing conflicts. Building upon insights from a wide range of disciplines (e.g., social psychology, political science, religious studies, anthropology, sociology) and existing findings about the processes that contribute to group conflict (e.g., perceived competition over scarce resources, incompatible values), this project tests hypotheses about where, how, under what circumstances, and for whom religion-influenced conflict could emerge. Employing an innovative Internet-based survey methodology, a large, international network of social and behavioral scientists will be recruited to provide data about 100 locales around the world. This method provides the ability to explore many locales, gather quantitative data about many relevant factors, reduce the potential impact of biases in expert informant?s reports, and conduct modern statistical analyses, thereby enabling the investigators to discover whether there are fundamental, cross-cultural principles through which religion may enhance or decrease conflict.

"612","Sinking Rates and Nutritional Quality of Organic Matter Exported from Sea Ice; the Importance of Exopolymeric Substances",NULL,"<p>Available data concerning the sinking rates of ice algae are highly divergent, while the characteristics of particles formed from other large organic pools in sea ice have received little study. As an initial step to remedy this situation, funds are provided to study the role of exopolymeric substances (EPS), produced by ice algae, in particle formation. The importance of EPS to particle coagulation and sinking rate is well established for temperate water columns. In sea ice, EPS comprise 20-70% of total particulate organic carbon, but their role in the sinking rate and composition of particles exported from sea ice is poorly understood. Based on previous studies, the PIs predict both positive and negative effects of EPS on particle sinking rate depending on EPS quantity. EPS also is predicted to increase the ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C:N) in the organic matter, which serves as a nutritional indicator.</p> 

<p>Based on documented trends in the EPS content of first-year Arctic sea ice, the PIs specifically predict slower sinking rates and higher C:N in particles produced after the export of ice algae, and from the upper levels of the ice column. They also predict slower sinking rates and higher C:N where snow cover is thicker. They will measure the sinking rates of particles released from melted sea-ice cores and test their hypotheses by relating the observed sinking rates to variables such as EPS concentration in the ice. Changes in the contribution of the sea-ice community to different flux periods will be investigated using microscopy and DNA-based molecular techniques. Finally, to help explain the spatial variability in the EPS content of sea ice, they will quantify EPS production rates of cultured ice algae as a function of light level. This work is designed to provide a conceptual framework for understanding and predicting spatial and temporal variability in the sinking rates and nutritional quality of particles released from Arctic sea ice in relation to variables measured in the ice such as: snow depth, chlorophyll, particulate organic carbon, and EPS.

<p>The ""biological pump,"" the photosynthetically mediated transformation of dissolved inorganic carbon into particulate and dissolved organic carbon in surface ocean waters and its subsequent export to deep water, is a significant driver of the atmospheric carbon uptake by the oceans. But this ""biologically pumped"" production, inasmuch as it depends on the composition and activity of planktonic organisms, is susceptible to long-term climatic changes in surface ocean properties such as increased temperature and changes in nutrient supply, especially in subtropical gyres. The sub-tropical gyres and the transition zones at their boundaries play an important role in the global carbon cycle because of their vast size and generally high per area export production. As evidenced in recent studies, the biological mechanisms driving regional to basin scale variability in carbon export in these biomes is far from understood, thus limiting our ability to mechanistically explain the biological pump and to predict its possible responses in the face of environmental change. In an effort to improve this situation with an accurate assessment of the contribution of different plankton groups to overall fluxes, the investigators will test the following two specific hypotheses:</p>

<p>1. The long held notion that large cells and those with mineral tests are major contributors to downward particle flux needs to be re-evaluated. We hypothesize that pico and nanoplankton (also those without mineral tests) are generally important contributors to downward particle flux at BATS. Consequently, the diversity of taxonomic groups contributing to particle flux is greater than previously expected. </p>

</p>2. The relative contribution of taxonomic groups to downward particle flux is a function of physical forcing. We hypothesize that episodic events (e.g., winter storms and eddies) lead to a reduction in diversity of sedimenting phytoplankton (e.g., dominance by a single group such as diatoms) compared to periods marked by more stable conditions in the water column.</p> 

<p>The broader impacts include furthering knowledge of the diversity and biology of phytoplankton groups that have a significant impact on the carbon export in subtropical gyres, thereby advancing our understanding of regional to basin scale variability in the biogeochemistry of these biomes.

Large and/or heavily-ballasted phytoplankton such as diatoms and coccolithophores are key contributors to carbon export due to their high sinking rates and direct routes of export through large zooplankton. The potential contributions of small, unballasted phytoplankton, through aggregation and/or trophic re-packaging, have been recognized more recently. This recognition comes as direct observations in the field show unexpected trends. In the Sargasso Sea, for example, shallow carbon export has increased in the last decade but the corresponding shift in phytoplankton community composition during this time has not been towards larger cells like diatoms. Instead, the abundance of the picoplanktonic cyanobacterium, <i>Synechococccus</i>, has increased significantly. The trophic pathways that link the increased abundance of <i>Synechococcus</i> to carbon export have not been characterized. These observations guided the investigators to their overarching research question, ""How do plankton size, community composition and trophic interactions modify carbon export from the euphotic zone?"" Since small phytoplankton are responsible for the majority of primary production in oligotrophic subtropical gyres, the trophic interactions that include them must be characterized in order to achieve a mechanistic understanding of the function of the biological pump in the oligotrophic regions of the ocean. This requires a complete characterization of the major organisms and their rates of production and consumption. Accordingly, the research objectives are: 1) to characterize (qualitatively and quantitatively) trophic interactions between major plankton groups in the euphotic zone and rates of, and contributors to, carbon export and 2) to develop a constrained food web model, based on these data, that will allow us to better understand current and predict near-future patterns in export production in the Sargasso Sea. The investigators will use a combination of field-based process studies and food web modeling to quantify rates of carbon exchange between key components of the ecosystem at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site. Measurements will include a novel, DNA-based approach to characterizing and quantifying planktonic contributors to carbon export. The well-documented seasonal variability at BATS and the occurrence of mesoscale eddies will be used as a natural laboratory in which to study ecosystems of different structure. This study is unique in that its aims to characterize multiple food web interactions and carbon export simultaneously and over similar time and space scales. A key strength of the proposed research is also the tight connection and feedback between the data collection and modeling components.</p>

<p>Characterizing the complex interactions between the biological community and export production is critical for predicting changes in phytoplankton species dominance, trophic relationships and export production that might occur under scenarios of climate-related changes in ocean circulation and mixing. This research may also help to understand the biological mechanisms that drive current regional to basin scale variability in carbon export in oligotrophic gyres. This proposal will contribute to the education of undergraduate and graduate students through the inclusion of student support. Undergraduate students in this project will be partly supported through Arizona State University (ASU)'s School of Life Sciences Undergraduate Research Program which seeks to increase the participation of minorities in science. Web and classroom materials based on this research will be developed and distributed through a partnership with the award-winning ASU-sponsored Ask A Biologist K-12 Web site.

"615","Pyrite (FeS2) Thin-Films for Photovoltaics",NULL,"<p>Pyrite is a potentially attractive and sustainable semiconductor for photovoltaic (PV) applications because of its low cost, abundance in the earth's crust, environmentally benign source material, and desirable electronic properties, such as 0.95 eV bandgap, high optical absorption coefficient, ease of n/p doping, high carrier mobility, and relatively long carrier lifetime; however, there has been only limited progress in producing high-quality pyrite thin films needed to explore the potential of this material for solar PV applications. The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop a fundamental understanding of the electronic and defect properties of doped and undoped pyrite thin films for solar photovoltaics.</p> 

<p>The Pis will develop a fundamental understanding of the thermodynamic and kinetic factors involved in producing high-quality epitaxial pyrite thin films, and determine how growth conditions influence the structural, chemical, electrical, and optical properties of the films. Furthermore, methods will be developed to produce high-quality pyrite thin-films with controlled n- and p-type doping, high carrier mobility, and long diffusion length that are useful for PV applications. Towards this end, a Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) process will be developed to enable film growth at high sulfur pressures, insuring that high quality pyrite films can be produced. A wide range of structural, chemical and electrical measurements, defect studies, and band-structure calculations will be used to characterize and analyze film properties. Growth studies will measure the sticking coefficient and resonance time of the impinging S and Fe as a function of temperature and reactant impingement rate, and the decomposition rate of pyrite will be measured in vacuum and under growth conditions. These experiments will be used to determine the rate-limiting steps for the forward and reverse reactions and, their influence on achieving high quality epitaxial pyrite films.</p>

<p>The proposed activities are designed to educate and inspire K-12 and graduate students in solar PV topics. First, a hands-on education module on solar PV technology will be developed and then presented to over 10,000 Arizona K-12 students through the Arizona State University (ASU) Science is Fun program. The module involves having students configure solar cells with various light sources to power an electronic device. The module will be delivered to K-12 classrooms by at least 15 undergraduate interns that are trained by the ASU LeRoy Eyring Center for Solid State Science. At least one third of the students that participate in the Science is Fun program will come from underrepresented groups. Second, for each year of the project, two high-school students will participate in the ASU Southwest Center for Education and the Natural Environment (SCENE) high?school program, where they will spend ten hours each week for a term in the Pis laboratory to develop a science-fair project involving the synthesis and characterization of pyrite materials for energy generation applications. Finally, graduate students will be trained in the fundamental aspects of PV technology and in the synthesis and characterization of thin films needed to be successful in the solar PV workforce. </p>","The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop a fundamental understanding of the electronic and defect properties of doped and undoped pyrite thin films for solar photovoltaics."

"617","The CUbiC CAReS Note-Taker: Enabling Students Who are Legally Blind to Take Notes in Class",NULL,"<p>Although the benefits of note-taking in the classroom are widely recognized, there has not been enough research focused on alleviating the difficulties encountered by legally blind and low vision students in their attempts to take notes during lecture. The problem is particularly acute in fast-paced STEM courses. Students who are legally blind typically write by placing their head close to the writing surface. They may be able to use a monocular to see what is being written on a board in the front of the classroom. But monoculars with high magnification also have narrow fields of view, which forces the student to ""hunt"" for the target at the front of the classroom each time s/he looks up from the writing surface. The repeated delay in switching between the writing surface and the board can make it hard for the student to keep up. In this project, the PI will develop and evaluate a portable Note-Taker device that does not require any adaptation of the existing classroom infrastructure, and which allows visually impaired students to shift their attention between the writing surface and the class presentation without inefficient context switching. The device will employ a Tablet PC, a zooming video camera, and an electronic pan/tilt mechanism, which can all be easily carried in a backpack and set up in a few seconds on any classroom desk. On the Tablet PC's display surface the student will be able both to see a zoomed video of the lecturer's presentation at the front of the classroom in real time, and to take notes with digital ink. The student will be able to adjust the camera's aim at any time by simply tapping on the point of interest in the video window on the display surface of the Tablet PC. The PI's goal is to go beyond mere ""accessibility"" and to create a device that allows legally blind students to take notes as efficiently as fully sighted students. Development and evaluation of the Note-Taker prototype will be done with the full involvement of legally blind and low vision students on the campus of Arizona State University, under the auspices of the Cognitive Ubiquitous Computing Center for Assistive and Rehabilitative Systems (CUbiC CAReS). The PI hypothesizes that his Note-Taking device will improve the learning of students who employ it in their secondary or post-secondary classrooms to take notes during lectures, and that it will also help those students to review their own notes at a later time, in conjunction with cross-referenced audio and video recordings.</p>

<p>Difficulties in note-taking are not limited to students with low vision. Students with certain learning disabilities, for example, often also have difficulty taking notes at the pace at which material is presented in the classroom.

"620","CISE RI: An Interdisciplinary Research Environment for Motion Analysis",NULL,"<p>Over the past decade, human motion analysis has become an important research area with critical applications. It is attracting significant research efforts in a number of disciplines, such as computer vision (vision-based motion capture, human computer interface, human identification), robotics (navigation), dance and choreography (automatic dance documentation and dance instruction), music (digital conducting) and bioengineering (rehabilitation and motor behavior). Motion analysis is a complex problem due to the 3D nature of the human body; the infinite possibilities of human movements; variability of movement execution between different people; continuously adaptive learning through feedback from and interactions with the environment; and the inherent multiple levels of movement structure in terms of time, space and energy. This makes it unrealistic for a single discipline to address all aspects. Therefore, progress within each discipline moves at a slow pace.</p> 

<p>Arizona State University has founded the Interdisciplinary Research Environment for Motion Analysis (IREMA) initiative that integrates researchers from ten disciplines to create a holistic model for motion analysis research and education. Within IREMA, ground-breaking collaborations have been established through networks of experts, infrastructures and important applications. Using this multi-level, networked research model, the principal investigators (PIs) are able to address many critical issues of real-time motion capture, analysis and feedback. Promising results of social significance are being achieved in areas such as: Rehabilitation Research to Restore Functional Walking Ability for Spinal Cord Injured, Auditory Display Systems for Aiding Interjoint Coordination, Modeling of Human and Robotic Heuristics for Projectile Interception, Movement Based Interactive Arts Environments, Experiential learning environments for children, Extraction and Recognition of Middle and Low Level Features of Movements, Vision-based Motion Capture Using Domain Knowledge.</p> 

<p>Using the research infrastructure (RI) grant the PIs will create a multimodal sensing and feedback environment for human motion analysis research and movement-based interactive applications. They will increase their optical motion capture system to 24 cameras, create a high-speed, high resolution 24 video camera array, complete the building of a pressure sensitive floor, acquire a new EMG system and metabolic sensing equipment, acquire required hardware to integrate optical motion capture data with EMG and 2D visual as well as metabolic sensing, increasing processing and storage capacity, creating a mobile motion capture setup, and deploying the necessary hardware and software for interactive real-time feedback. The above sensing equipment would provide high-speed, high quality, synchronous video capture of multiple views, high-precision marker-based motion capture and pressure sensing in the floor as well as on the treadmill, and audio signals. It will enable the PIs to capture human movement in its full essence. The optical motion-capture data and the pressure sensing data will be fused to provide holistic motion capture. The processed, combined data of these systems will be used to train the video based system so that robust and accurate vision-based motion-capture can be acquired using low-cost video cameras. The physiological equipment will be used in the rehabilitation projects. </p>

<p>During this five-year project, the Pis hope to achieve major advances in motion analysis and core computer science areas: computer vision, human-computer interaction, information and data management, geometric computation, knowledge systems and robotics. These advances will have significant social impact by producing major progress in movement rehabilitation and therapy, K-12 education, security applications (gait/face recognition), and all areas involving movement training (dance, theatre, sports, firefighting, military).

"625","Interaction of Engineering Nanomaterials with Artificial Cell Membranes",NULL,"<p>Over the past five years, there has been a growing interest in the health-related issue of toxicity of engineered nanomaterials. Cells have various routes for uptake of molecules and particles through their cell membranes to control their internal environment including highly selective membrane proteins and peptides as well as protein mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis. Nanoparticle (NP) based drug delivery and molecular imaging applications that deliver NP into cells typically use biochemical functionalization which promote specific signaling and uptake. The lipid bilayers that make up cellular membranes are believed to be impenetrable to ions and unfunctionalized macromolecules, however, epidemiological studies have shown that unfunctionalized NPs can, under some conditions, cross or disrupt the cell membrane through passive, unmediated routes causing acute cellular toxicity and cell death. The unmediated NP adsorption onto and the uptake into cells is poorly understood. Recent research focuses on either collection of empirical epidemiological data (e.g. uptake of NP by cells, toxicity to organisms such as rats or fish) or precise NP characterization (e.g. size, shape, degree of aggregation, charge, and surface chemistry). However, it is almost impossible to transition from these measurements to detailed understanding of the mechanisms responsible for unmediated NP uptake into cells and disruption of the bilayer. Quantitative measures of nanomaterial bioavailability and toxicity need to be assessed so that the impact of nanotechnology on human health and the environment can be addressed.</p> 

<p>The intellectual merit of the proposed work is to understand the mechanisms and conditions under which engineered nanomaterials can cause disruption of, and passive transport through, simplified model cell membranes, namely lipid bilayers.

The interaction of nanoparticles and lipid bilayers are unique because the particle and membranes have nearly the same length scale</p>. 

<p>Fundamental understanding of the interaction between NP and lipid bilayers is potentially transformative because it may: (1) improve our understanding of toxicity of engineered and environmental NP; (2) enable rational design of benign NP for delivery of drugs and biomedical/molecular imaging; (3) result in high-throughput toxicity testing protocols; and (4) evidence-based regulation and protocols of nanomaterials. An experimental platform and methods will be developed for quantifying the NP transport through lipid membranes in real time as a function of the NP and lipid properties and the physicochemical environment.

At the high school level, curricula material will be developed and implemented for energy literacy that incorporates both engineering/technical aspects and an understanding of the interconnections between energy systems, human society, and the environment. To advance the understanding and use of technological progress models in decision-making, a workshop will be held near Washington D.C. to engage energy R&D and policy communities.","The objective of this research is to advance modeling of technological progress of alternative energies by developing and applying new methods to (1) estimate long-term bounds on economic and environmental performance, (2) assess life cycle economic and environmental costs, and (3) assess uncertainty in technological forecasting"

Specifically, this proposal: (i)bis developing WaterHUB (by utilizing Purdue HUBZero platform) to include prototype tools for accessing, analyzing and visualizing water resources geospatial and temporal data; (ii) is developing a prototype framework for collaboration among educators to develop, publish, review and share training material for using cyberinfrastructure to address water issues; (iii) is evaluating and assessing the effectiveness of the proposed cyberinfrastructure and the collaborative framework through application at three universities (Purdue, Arizona State U, Jackson State U); and (iv) is building community through workshops and training sessions for teachers, students, policy makers and the general public. This demonstration project will show proof-of-concept for a scalable mechanism to create water resources awareness among a much broader community by incorporating the needs of a diverse population through collaboration with faculty and students at three geographically and culturally diverse research institutions in the United States. External evaluation and assessment of all aspects of this demonstration project including community input through workshops and training sessions will provide the basis for developing a plan for scaling up the project. </p>

<p>This proposal involves a group of hydrologists, computer scientists, an educational expert and an environmental researcher at three geographically and culturally different institutions (Purdue, Arizona State and Jackson State) to develop a CI for data access, analysis and visualization to study water resources issues including collaboration for teaching and training. Specifically, this proposal will use a proven CI, initially developed for nanotechnology (nanoHUB.org that has more than 100,000 users annually), to develop a customized cyber environment for water resources called WaterHUB. The core nanohub CI, known as HUBZero, is inadequate to handle large spatial and temporal datasets that are typical in water related studies, and lacks the capability to link such data with data driven, computationally intensive hydrologic simulations. This work will add the much needed data and coupling of data and high performance computing to HUBzero to support water resources studies. WaterHUB will be the first of its kind in the water resources community that will provide a collaborative web-based platform for research and education at all levels including P-12. The prototype WaterHUB is being developed to address three basic questions related to water storage, human impacts and energy fluxes by using public domain data and simulation models to address water related problems. This project also involves a comprehensive evaluation and assessment plan that will quantify the effect of cyber-enabled pedagogy on students learning. This assessment is critical in terms of evaluating the attributes of existing and future CI to meet the needs of next generation cyber learners and researchers.

Through collaboration with Jackson State and Arizona State universities, under-represented students are being trained through workshops and summer internships to use the latest cyber technology for exploring water related issues. In addition, workshop gatherings will be used to develop a strategy for up-scaling this effort to include more computational tools, national and international datasets and high quality curriculum material.

"632","Public Value Mapping: Developing a Non-Economic Model of the Social Value of Science and Innovation Policy",NULL,"<p>Science and innovation policies (SIPs) aim at mobilizing knowledge in support of a wide range of societal aspirations and values. However, analytical tools and models for the assessment of SIPs focus predominantly on economic values. Analytical tools for assessing social impacts of science tend to be anchored in microeconomics (e.g. benefit-cost analysis). The assumptions upon which economics of innovation models and attendant tools are based inevitably affect SIP assessments and choices. For example, the tendency to focus on ""science and technology as the engine of economic growth"" has contributed in part to the limited attention to equity in the distribution of the impacts of research activities. Values not easily expressed in economic terms receive less attention simply owing to the absence of compelling and concrete ways of thinking about them. </p>

<p>Nearly all observers, including economists, recognize that some social values are not well accounted for by economic models and measures. The influence of economic models in SIP is in part explained by limited progress in developing ways to conceptualize those science- and innovation-related values not easily expressed in monetary terms. The purpose of this study is to further develop a public-values-based model for SIP. At the core of this work are two fundamental questions: What are the public values that justify particular SIPs, and what is the capacity of a given SIP to yield outcomes that support and advance those values? </p>

<p>The research operationalizes these questions and applies them to the development of a SIP decision model using a method that the researchers term Public Value Mapping (PVM). Core assumptions of PVM are: (1) that it is possible to identify public values, including ones not well captured by economic constructs; (2) just as one can assess market failure, ""public value failure"" occurs when neither the market nor the public sector provides goods and services required to achieve designated public values; and (3) innovation can be characterized not only in terms of contributions to economic growth and productivity but also in terms of public values achieved.</p> 

<p>This work entails theory development as well as case studies to advance and test the PVM model. Four case studies (as well as three additional studies funded from other sources) are then inter-linked by a common analytical framework, bringing multiple perspectives to the analysis. Case studies are designed specifically to draw from current PVM theory while also testing and improving the theory. Each case begins with an explicit statement of the public values analyzed, and proceeds to ""map"" progress toward public values by modeling the distinctive innovation process in which each case is embedded. Integration of case studies adds empirical robustness to the PVM model.</p> 

<p>A new model of innovation based on widely shared, non-economic values--public values--would represent a major intellectual advance in the study and analysis of science and innovation policies. This study: (1) advances understanding of the links between SIPs and public values; (2) further develops Public Value Mapping in terms of a ""churn model"" of innovation, emphasizing the social impacts of innovations and the capacity of innovation systems to create new beneficial impacts; and (3) develops the PVM model as a new theoretically and empirically grounded foundation for assessing and designing SIPs.</p> 

<p>The new model of innovation will provide SIP analysts a theoretical and methodological foundation for assessing and informing science and innovation investment and institutional design decisions, using public values as the measure of success. The model is also meant to be a crucial first step toward developing public-values-oriented SIP decision tools that could be widely deployed in SIP decision making processes.</p>","The purpose of this study is to further develop a public-values-based model for science and innovation policies (SIPs).

"633","Combining Methods from Geochemistry and Molecular Biology to Predict the Functions of Microbial Communities",NULL,"<p>Combining geochemical data with microbial ecological data makes it possible to predict the distribution of microbial populations and the processes that they catalyze in nature. In this research we will focus on the contrasting microbial processes of methane production (e.g., methanogenesis) and methane consumption (e.g., methanotrophy) as a framework for evaluating the linkages between geochemical predictions and the distribution, diversity, and activity of organisms that catalyze these processes. The overarching rationale for targeting these biological processes is that the combined activities of methanogenesis and methanotrophy largely control the flux of the potent greenhouse gas methane to our atmosphere, the extent of which may significantly impact global climate. Defining the constraints on the distribution of microbial populations catalyzing these two processes in nature can significantly advance our understanding of the impact that a perturbation to their environment would have on their respective activities and the consequence that this may have on the global carbon cycle. Existing geochemical predictions from hydrothermal ecosystems in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming indicate that the occurrence of populations catalyzing methane production should be highly proscribed, but that aerobic and anaerobic methanotrophy should be widespread and that populations engaged in these activities should display significant genetic diversity as a function of the spring fluid composition. The thermodynamic predictions will be used to guide experiments aimed to interpret data on the distribution of methanogens and methanotrophs and their respective activities. The integration of geochemical data and biological data will be achieved using newly developed ecological modeling tools. These models will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the extent to which the distribution, diversity, and activity of functional groups of microorganisms reflect the physical and chemical characteristics of their environment. Defining the extent to which such relationships exist using this framework has critical implications for our understanding of the constraints which led to extant biodiversity and will enable predictions of how changes in environmental conditions will affect the functioning of those microbial ecosystems.</p>

The goal of the investigators conducting this project is to discover configurations of diversity in ecological landscapes and in forms of social organization that make systems more or less able to cope with significant environmental or social changes without undergoing an unpleasant transformation. The researchers will focus on a few important variables indicating both social diversity (integration, conformity, and hierarchy) and ecological diversity (diversity of plant and animal species and of patches on the landscape). To understand the relationships of interest, they will develop mathematical models of the interactions of key variables and conduct extensive quantitative analysis of data from empirical studies of millennium-long societal trajectories. They will examine five archaeological cases from the southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico as long-term ""experiments"" to see how diversity in the social and ecological realms affected these societies' abilities to thrive or forced them into dramatic transformations when faced with different environmental or social stimuli. The outcomes of these analyses will provide the basis for dynamic modeling designed to investigate the broad range of conditions in which these domains of diversity contribute to varying responses to change across different time scales. Model analyses conducted using dynamical systems and numerical techniques will begin with simple social situations coupled with simple landscapes followed by step-wise modifications designed to ""complexify"" both social and ecological modeled landscapes.

This project will demonstrate the value of integrating insights from ecology and archaeology, the importance of balancing concerns for social and ecological processes, and the ability of archaeology to contribute to understanding the role of diversity in the resilience of social-ecological systems. As societies cope with inevitable change, their actions generate vulnerabilities. Lack of awareness of these dynamics can contribute to the need for costly transformations. When made more aware of the complex dynamics of change as they have functioned in the past, people can better weigh the implications of their decisions and build resilience to such vulnerabilities. This project will demonstrate how interactions associated with social and ecological diversity can inform contemporary policies dealing with sustainability, robustness, vulnerability, and transformative change.

Perry Mesa, located 90 miles north of Phoenix, was occupied by prehistoric farmers living in large aggregated villages from approximately A.D. 1275-1450. Agricultural land use focused on runoff, a strategy in which fields are placed in locations that receive additional inputs of water from runoff flowing down gentle hillslopes during intense storms. The construction of small terraces perpendicular to the slope maximizes water retention and renews fertility by capturing organic debris and sediments washing down slope. The region abounds with the remains of these prehistoric farming systems. It is not clear whether the extensiveness of agricultural fields on Perry Mesa reflects high agricultural potential or the fact that farming was difficult, requiring significant investment in the landscape to improve its productivity. In addition, the density of prehistoric fields could indicate that these farmers needed to practice a land-extensive cultivation strategy that involved frequent rotation of fields to maintain soil fertility. Using the prehistoric occupation of Perry Mesa as a case study, Kruse-Peeples will take an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on archaeology and ecology to understand the long-term productivity and sustainability of agriculture in arid regions.</p> 

<p>This project integrates archaeological investigations of the prehistoric settlements and farming systems with ecological methods of soil nutrient analysis and soil moisture measurements. Analyses include (1) investigation of how effective terrace systems are at capturing and retaining surface runoff, (2) determination of the soil fertility and renewal through nutrient analysis of agricultural soils and runoff , (3) a simulation model to determine the dynamics of soil fertility over time as crops extract nutrients and management of surface runoff renews fertility, (4) a GIS analysis to document the distribution of landscape modifications on Perry Mesa, and (5) reconstruction of the prehistoric population based on the size of archaeological sites to determine the amount of land required to support these communities. Together, these analyses will provide a characterization of the agricultural potential of the Perry Mesa landscape that assesses how technologies such as terracing and practices such as management of runoff relate to agricultural productivity. Kruse-Peeples will use this information to determine if the agricultural landuse in the Perry Mesa region was sustainable, and if potential landscape depletion was a factor in why the area was eventually abandoned after less than 200 years of occupation. </p>

This project seeks to understand how ecosystem services change in response to extraction or addition of water to ecosystems due to population change and climate change. The project will look at how the value of ecosystem services changes in response to decreases in water availability and to increases in water availability to these systems. The standing hypothesis is that once dewatered, restoration of hydrologic conditions will result in a lower level of ecosystem services and value than was originally found in these ecosystems. The utilization of existing data on dewatering and on restoration will provide a robust library of understanding of how the value of ecosystems services in riparian systems change in response to hydrologic and biological conditions.

If so, what are the conductivities of different hydrogen-bonded networks of water bridges? Is there quantum interference between different electron transport pathways associated with the networks?</p> 

<p>In order to provide students with interdisciplinary and international training experience, this project will leverage several on-campus undergraduate and graduate research programs to recruit and train students from chemistry and other programs; host international students and collaborate with international researchers; and start a community outreach program via working with local public schools that have large minority enrollments. </p>","In this study, Professor Nongjian Tao and his research group at Arizona State University will develop single molecule break-junction techniques to study electronic conductance through polyaromatic hydrocarbon molecules and molecular bridge structures formed from water."

"645","Accelerating Innovation in Agent-Based Simulations: Application to Complex Socio-Behavioral Phenomena",NULL,"<p>Increasingly, the engineering of complex systems requires consideration of an intricate web of components and their interaction in diverse social and technical environments. Simulation can assist in designing and testing socio-technical systems by allowing the potential space of outcomes to be explored under given designs. Agent-based models have been developed as a method for building models of complex systems, with great success. Agents may be designed to represent system components and to specify the interactions between them in an incredible level of detail. While popular, the full potential of the methodology to support engineering of complex systems has not been reached, however, because of a set of key challenges. First, there exists a relative lack of robust methods for calibrating agent-based models to theory. Second, there is a paucity of reliable approaches for extracting coarse-grained, system level information as it emerges in agent-based simulations. Third, there is a dearth of schemes for handling uncertainty in the application of agent-based rules to system behavior. Fourth, computation of agent-based models is inefficient when agents are numerous in volume and richly-specified in behavior. Together, these impediments constrain the ability of agent-based modeling to enable prediction, to support decisions, and to facilitate the design, control, and optimization of complex systems. The main objective of this project is to broaden the extensibility of agent-based modeling beyond these constraints. This will be achieved by developing novel computational methods to fuse agent-based modeling, uncertainty measurement and quantification, and mathematics for pattern-extraction. </p>

<p>This project will expand the capabilities of agent-based modeling in supporting the design, engineering, and testing of complex systems. Our initial focus is to develop a prototype scheme that can be applied to complex socio-behavioral systems, but the project is of potential relevance across a diverse array of substantive areas. Indeed, one of our central aims is to provide the glue that can bridge diverse schemes for agent-based simulation across application areas.

The research will seek to advance the state-of-the-art in crowd modeling by representing individuals, crowds, and the ambient city with rich detail. Models will be built with theory-informed algorithms that capture the intricacies of human behavior. The model will be realized as a fully immersive three-dimensional environment that engages both the public and students, and it will convey intuitively complicated ideas about human movement and crowd behavior. A robust calibration and validation scheme will be employed to facilitate evaluation of policies and plans in simulation and mapping of models to real-world scenarios in public health, downtown revitalization, public safety, defense, large-scale event-planning, escape, evacuation, and emergencies.</p>

As apparent in nature, enzymes associated with surfaces have additional abilities that soluble enzymes lack. Organized, surface-associated enzyme systems can catalyze whole reaction pathways much more efficiently than the same enzymes in solution. In order to incorporate surface-immobilized enzyme systems into useful applications there are challenges that need to be overcome. One is to improve the activities and stabilities of surface-bound enzymes by optimizing their orientations and conformations as well as their surface attachment distances. The other is to control the spatial relationships between the components of multi-enzyme cascades on surfaces aiming to maximize their catalytic efficiencies.</p>

<p>Principal Investigators Neal Woodbury and Hao Yan of Arizona State University believe they know how to accomplish this, and then offer a method to improve the opportunity. They intend to explore peptide space (from known libraries) to identify ligands that will bind to target enzymes and optimize their orientations on surfaces to achieve active functions. This will allow them to create and analyze single- and multi-enzyme systems on peptide-modified solid surfaces. The improvements come by next creating self-assembled DNA nanoscaffold surfaces, which will allow precise control over parameters including inter-enzyme orientation and spacing as well as the distances from enzymes to surfaces or scaffolds. After demonstrating this with the pair of enzymes, a third enzyme can be added for further enhancement.</p>

There are three parts to the project. First, an analysis of individual components of the photosynthetic apparatus in cells (the light harvesting complexes and the reaction center) coupled with an analysis of their action together under well defined conditions will allow the generation of a quantitative structure/function model. Next, by varying light regimes, it is possible to change the relative amounts and presumably the organization of the different components, making it possible to refine the model so that it takes into account the range of different architectures that the apparatus can assume. Finally, the higher order structure and function of the photosynthetic apparatus will be monitored as a function of its development, starting from aerobic conditions where it is largely absent and removing oxygen which initiates the production and assembly of the components. An understanding of membrane system assembly in this model system will aid the much broader field of membrane structure/function relationships.

In this project the PI will continue his studies of the purple nonsulfur bacterium <i>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</i>, investigating the driving force and temperature dependence of the initial electron transfer reactions. The PI has used a form of reaction diffusion theory, applied previously to electron transfer in viscous solvents, to describe the complex kinetics of electron transfer as a function of driving force and temperature. This approach has been remarkably successful, implying that protein conformational changes initiated by light absorption control the observed kinetics instead of a static barrier crossing between two potential surfaces. Several important questions have been raised by this work that need to be answered. First, the nature of the protein motion and the spectroscopic signal at 280 nm that appears to be a probe of this motion are unclear. It is currently hypothesized that this is due to tryptophan residues responding to changes in the protein environment, but this remains to be proven. Second, a more detailed mechanistic exploration of the relationship between protein relaxation and electron transfer is necessary. This new model provides an opportunity to determine the reorganization energy, driving force and coupling for a whole series of mutants as a function of temperature, resulting in a much more complete mechanistic picture of initial photosynthetic electron transfer than has ever been available previously. Finally, this work will be merged with current directed evolution approaches to produce mutants that undergo high yield electron transfer along the normally unused cofactor pathway (the B-side).

As a large scale agent of change, shifts in policy and perceptions concerning immigrants ripple through social networks, affecting household arrangements and resources that impact not only individuals, but families and whole communities. These impacts are felt by immigrants, naturalized citizens and natives who share the same communities, households and families. Recent research suggests that social networks among the urban poor can be eroded by macro-level economic and political uncertainty and instability, but comparatively little is known about how this process unfolds. Clear scientific evidence demonstrating how people are affected by such policy shifts can provide evidence for developing immigration-related policy and practice with fewer negative unintended consequences. With backgrounds in sociology, anthropology, human biology, geography and demography, the project team examined Latino households with at least one Spanish-speaking adult in south Phoenix, Arizona. Households were recruited by partnering with Latino community educators who are well-established in the area. Field interviews were conducted by bilingual students at Arizona State University. Using a range of tools and methods, including social network analysis and mathematical modeling, researchers determined if and how the households reorganized in response to changing immigration policy and practice. The study examined the social networks that link household members to each other and larger networks, and model the implications of this for the resource flows to household members and ultimately for household resiliency and the well-being of family members. Agent-based models were then applied to examine the potential impact of future large-scale shifts in immigration perceptions and policies.</p>

"655","Surface Flux for Cracked and Intact Clays for Ponded and Sloped Conditions",NULL,"<p>Assumptions of extremes of wetted state of unsaturated soils during infrastructure lifetime (saturated or dry properties) have significant implications for design, construction, functionality, safety, and structural longevity. Assessment of the degree of saturation that occurs in the subsurface requires understanding and quantifying actual surface flux, a complex function of soil surface conditions, including in particular soil suction, degree of cracking, and slope geometry. There are two major related research issues yet to be adequately addressed in geotechnical applications: (1) the effect of surface cracking in volume-change-sensitive clays on unsaturated flow property functions, and (2) the effect of drainage conditions (well-sloped surface versus poorly drained) on surface flux of cracked and intact clays. Seasonal cracking of soil results in poor estimates of runoff and infiltration due to the changing soil storage conditions (Arnold et al, 2005). Prediction of soil suction profiles requires substantial improvements in current capabilities, both from a soil property and numerical modeling perspective. Several conditions present numerical solution challenges: (i) strong nonlinearities in soil properties, (ii) abrupt changes of moisture conditions at the surface boundary and wetting front, and (iii) the presence of surface runoff conditions (Scanlon et. al., 2002). The behavior of unsaturated cracked soil is quite different from that of intact soil, further complicating evaluation of surface flux conditions for clays.</p> 

<p>This study addresses key remaining questions rarely, or only superficially, discussed in the geotechnical literature, and is geared toward transformation of surface flux modeling capabilities for cracked and intact clays. The geotechnical research team will work with a co-investigator in Applied Math towards addressing these needs through development of: (1) data and models for unsaturated soil properties of cracked clays including volume change of both the cracks and matrix; (2) data and models for run-off for well-inclined (sloped) and level-grade cracked and intact (3) improved solution methods for surface flux, including run-off, and (4) evaluation of field damage related to drainage and cracking for consistency with modeling and data. A key element of this research is the collaboration and sharing of physical resources among partners (Arizona State University's [ASU] advanced unsaturated soils testing equipment and San Diego State University's [SDSU] unique tilt table). </p>

<p>A wide range of problems arise from unsaturated soils. Damage to infrastructure from expansive clays alone is estimated to be as much as 15 billion/yr (Nuhfer et al., 1993; Wray and Meyer 2004). Krohn and Slossom (1980) estimated that 20% of surface soils of the U.S. are subject to shrink-swell (and cracking). Concerns over movement of contaminants to great depth have heightened interest in understanding unsaturated flow and the complex interactions between climate, human surface activities and unsaturated soil subsurface conditions and processes. Researchers have demonstrated the role of unsaturated soil behavior in rainfall-induced slope failure (Toll, 1999; Yin, 1998). Surface flux and surface runoff are critical to the performance of slopes, and little is known about the influence of cracks on the flux or on slope stability itself. In California in 1982, over 18,000 slides swept down slopes with little warning, damaging homes and killing 14 residents (Ellen and Wieczorek, 1988). U.S. costs for landslide repairs exceed $2 billion/yr and landslides, nearly all rainfall-induced, result in 25-50 deaths/yr (Spike and Gori, 2003). This research will have impact on solutions to all of these problems through enhancing our understanding and modeling of surface flux and unsaturated flow.</p>

"657","Advancement of Unsaturated Soils Theory into the Undergraduate Civil Engineering Curriculum",NULL,"Most of our physical infrastructure is built on unsaturated soils, yet for both technical and historical reasons, educators continue to reserve the teaching of unsaturated soil mechanics to the graduate level curriculum. Billions of dollars are at risk annually from moisture-sensitive soil damage to infrastructure. At the other extreme, billions of dollars are wasted annually due to overly conservative structures that are designed based on an assumption of saturated soil properties. Improving student understanding of unsaturated soil behavior could result in large cost savings in both the public and private sectors. In addition, a recent survey indicates that a majority of geotechnical faculty think that unsaturated soils mechanics should be introduced at the undergraduate level. Students' depth of understanding of soils as an engineering material would be greatly enhanced via introduction of geotechnical principles for unsaturated conditions, with the saturated soil case being presented as a subset of the broader theory. This project involves developing student-centered lecture and laboratory modules on the basic principles of unsaturated soils theory and the application of these principles to problems of movement of structural foundation systems. The modules emphasize solving geo-hazard problems of collapsible and expansive soils. Emerging geotechnical challenges in the energy sector are used as additional motivational examples. These modules are being pilot-tested on students at seven universities, with a large and diverse set of students to ensure that the modules are not biased toward a particular subset of students.","This project involves developing student-centered lecture and laboratory modules on the basic principles of unsaturated soils theory and the application of these principles to problems of movement of structural foundation systems.

"661","Culturally Specific Substance Abuse Prevention for Urban American Indian Youth",NULL,"Morbidity and mortality rates of many preventable conditions are disproportionately high in many American Indian (Al) populations. Well documented health disparities for Al adults and youth related to abuse of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs extend to the growing urban Al population, who now constitute over 60% of the total Al population. Al youth report higher rates, earlier onset, more severe consequences, yet less perceived risk of harm of substance use compared to their non-native counterparts. To thwart the early onset and aftermath of substance abuse, primary prevention efforts have been undertaken with Al youth in several U.S. regions. But programs have not explicitly targeted urban Al youth using rigorous culturally grounded prevention methods. The proposed study draws upon the project team's research on the etiology of substance use among Al youth of the urban southwest to conduct translational research that recognizes salient risk and resiliency factors identified by these youth, social and relational contexts that expose them to substances, and their culturally appropriate drug resistance strategies. The first aim of the study is to create a culturally grounded substance abuse prevention intervention targeting urban Al youth in 7th and 8th grades through a modification of a SAMHSA Model universal prevention program, keepin it REAL. The adaptation will employ emerging principles for adapting programs for new target populations in ways that increase cultural fit while maintaining fidelity to core program components. The intervention will be adapted, piloted, evaluated, culturally validated, and revised accordingly. A second aim is to test the feasibility and efficacy of the adapted substance abuse prevention intervention in a randomized control trial (RCT). Ecodevelopmental Theory provides the framework for understanding key influences on Al youths' substance use. Participatory action research methods will be used to adapt the intervention, including focus groups with key Al informants (adults and youth), working in collaboration with the designers of the original intervention and in coordination with the area's largest provider of social services to urban Indians. The RCT will be conducted in existing groups for Al students enrolled in urban school districts. The resulting prevention intervention will address the needs of an under-served group severely affected by health disparities, and advance knowledge on effective translational research strategies for adapting prevention interventions for ethnically diverse youth.","The proposed study draws upon the project team's research on the etiology of substance use among American Indian youth of the urban Southwest to conduct translational research that recognizes salient risk and resiliency factors identified by these youth, social and relational contexts that expose them to substances, and their culturally appropriate drug resistance strategies."
"662","Novel Approaches to Studying the Situ Bioremediation of Complex Mixtures",NULL,"The vast majority of Superfund sites in the U.S and the Baltimore/Chesapeake Bay area contain mixtures of organic and inorganic compounds that contaminate underlying aquifers. The environmental fate of these contaminants, and ultimately human exposure to them, is governed primarily by their interactions with microorganisms, which &ndash; individually or as a community &ndash; drive the process of in situ bioremediation. Whereas single pollutant/microorganism interactions can be determined easily in the lab, no satisfactory tools exist for predicting the fate of mixtures in the environment. Our long-term goal is to improve the success rate of bioremediation at sites containing complex chemical mixtures by using in situ microcosm array (ISMA) technology. The ISMA is a field-deployable, miniaturized laboratory consisting of a large number of small microcosms arranged in parallel. Upon deployment, incubation, and retrieval from a groundwater well, the ISMA can be analyzed to reveal the impact of mixture components on the rates of Dollutant degradation and on the structure and function of microbial communities. We hypothesize that the ISMA can aid in the design of bioremediation strategies because: (1) individual ISMA microcosms can be amended with multiple test substances to elucidate the effect of mixture components on microorganisms; (2) the response of microorganisms to presented compounds manifests itself as changes in biomass, community structure and function; and (3) these changes can be detected conveniently by biochemical, genetic and proteomic strategies. Based on the above observations, the specific aims of the project are to: 1. Determine the reproducibility and discriminatory power of the ISMA technology. We will explore how varying concentrations of inducers and co-contaminants in synthetic groundwater modulate the expression of the dioxin dioxygenase (Ddase) of Sphingomonas wittichii Strain RW1, by using a large number of replicates in conjunction with semi-automated, high-throughput proteomic mass spectrometry. 2. Demonstrate in controlled laboratory conditions how the ISMA can reveal additive, synergistic, and antagonistic effects of mixture components on microbial communities. We will use defined mixtures of chemicals (e.g., dioxins, PCBs, PAHs, tolualdeyhyde, Cd, Cr, Co, Pb, Hg, Zn, Ni) and bacteria (five bioremediation agents) to study these effects in various permutations. 3. Evaluate the utility of the ISMA technology in simulated field conditions. We will conduct ISMA laboratory experiments using nonsterile groundwater, sediment, and natural microbial communities. 4. Deploy the ISMA device at a Maryland Superfund site. We will assess the utility of the new technology in a field demonstration study by examining survival of and Ddase expression by Strain RW1 in situ, and by elucidating the impact of this introduced bacterium on the indigenous microbial community at the site.","The long-term goal is to improve the success rate of bioremediation at sites containing complex chemical mixtures by using in situ microcosm array (ISMA) technology."
"663","Role of Human Intestinal Microbiota on Success of Surgical Weight Loss Procedures",NULL,"Obesity is a growing epidemic in the United States. The prevalence of obesity in adults has increased by over 75% since 1980, and, presently, more than half of the United States population is overweight, with nearly 1 in 3 adults being clinically obese. Obesity arises as a consequence of alterations in how the body regulates energy intake, expenditure, and storage. Recently, it has been suggested that the gut microbiota has an effect in energy extraction, hence obesity. Humans and mice harbor fewer Bacteroidetes and more Firmicutes than those of their lean counterparts. Also, fermenters and Methanobrevibacter smithii (a methanogen from the Archaea domain) appear to act syntrophically to affect energy uptake. Using high- throughput molecular methods, we confirmed that the microbiota of obese and normal-weight individuals differ and showed that the microbiota in patients following successful bariatric surgery are unique. Bariatric surgery is currently the only available treatment for morbid obesity that consistently achieves and maintains substantial weight loss, decreases the incidence and severity of obesity-related co-morbidities, and improves overall quality of life and survival. Based on our past work, we hypothesize that the dramatic change in the intestinal microbiota that occurs following RYGB may play a significant role in the success and/or eventual failure of RYGB. The primary goal of the proposed research is to assess the role of the human- intestinal microbial ecology on success or failure to lose weight following two common methods of bariatric surgery: the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB). We will: 1) Use high-throughput sequencing to identify fermenters that interact with a particular group of H2-consuming microorganisms; 2) Track and quantify the presence of luminal and mucosal H2-consuming microorganisms using quantitative PCR; 3) Track metabolic products and determine syntrophies and metabolic functions of the microorganisms associated with energy extraction; and (4) Integrate and interpret the results using an ecological approach through mathematical modeling. Identifying the key syntrophic partnerships should reveal useful markers of obesity risk and successful weight loss following bariatric surgery. They also should lead to microorganism-based therapeutic strategies to improve the chance of success of bariatric surgery and other weight- loss approaches. This project will investigate microorganisms that live in the human intestines and how they affect success or failure of weight loss after two methods of bariatric surgery. The ultimate goal is to find microorganisms that help weight loss following bariatric surgery.","This project will investigate microorganisms that live in the human intestines and how they affect success or failure of weight loss after two methods of bariatric surgery.

"664","Carbon Nanotubes: A New Synthetic Nanopore for Sequencing",NULL,"Nanopore sequencing offers the possibility of rapid single molecule sequencing with long reads, almost no sample preparation, and direct electronic readout from a small, computer-chip-like device. Nanopores are orifices that are so small that electrophoretic translocation of DNA through them necessarily occurs one base at a time. All nanopores require some means of localizing DNA with atomic precision as well as controlling its speed of translocation through the pore. Here, we introduce an entirely new type of nanopore for the DNA translocation, the single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT). SWCNTs are relatively homogeneous on an atomic scale, easy to manufacture with no special nanofabrication, and can form excellent electrodes, simplifying tunneling readout and opening the possibility of electrochemical readout. Their high aspect ratio (channel length/channel diameter) might permit trapping of the DNA in the tube, opening a new avenue for control of translocation speed. Molecular dynamics simulations have predicted that single-stranded DNA can be driven through a 2 nm diameter SWCNT by an electric field. We have confirmed this prediction experimentally, building devices in which a single SWCNT connects two fluid reservoirs and using PCR to verify DNA translocation. Arizona State University will direct the project and focus on device fabrication and DNA translocation. Oak Ridge National Laboratory will focus on multiscale modeling of ion and DNA transport through SWCNTs. Columbia University will focus on the construction of nm-scale gaps in SWCNTs. At the end of the two-year project we will: (a) Have developed robust device fabrication procedures and made devices available to the research community; (b) We will have obtained an understanding of the factors controlling the transport of ions and DNA through the tubes; (c) We will have identified factors that affect the speed of DNA translocation and the length of polymers that can be passed in one read; and (d) We will have built prototype devices in which a tunnel gap is integrated into a single SWCNT nanopore device. These developments should accelerate development of nanopore technology towards the production of a cheap, fast, and reliable DNA sequencing chip. If successful, the new technology could enable ultra-low cost, single molecule sequencing with long reads, making whole-genome studies available to the general population. Making a search of whole genomes for rare variants economically feasible has many implications for medicine.","This new technology could enable ultra-low cost, single molecule sequencing with long reads, making whole-genome studies available to the general population.

The goals of this proposal are to extend the measurements to nucleotides in aqueous electrolyte, and then to small oligomers. We will quantify the fraction of single-molecule reads and determine the factors that control this fraction with the goal of eliminating signals that come from more than one nucleotide in the gap at a time. We will explore the factors that control the width of the distribution of current signals for all four bases (and 5-methyl C) with the goal of improving the discrimination of a single read. We will measure the fraction of successful reads and characterize the time required for the complex (that gives rise to the signal) to form in the tunnel gap. From these measurements, we will identify improvements needed to increase the readout efficiency and also develop criteria for design of a nanopore sequencing system equipped with tunneling electrodes. The reagents developed during the course of this research will be made available to other research groups developing nanopore sequencers that use electron tunneling as the readout. At least seven NIH-supported groups are exploring sequencing methods that propose to use electron tunneling as the readout for a nanopore sequencer, an approach that might greatly reduce the cost of sequencing.

"666","Instrument to Optimize DNA Sequencing by Recognition Tunneling",NULL,"Nanopore sequencing is a technique in which DNA is driven electrophoretically through an orifice so small that each base must pass through one at a time. Translocation of thousands of bases of single stranded DNA has been demonstrated. If such long sequence runs could be read rapidly and accurately with no need for chemical reagents or the preparation of elaborate libraries, costs might be reduced to the point where personal genomes would become available for clinical use. Readouts based on the blockading of ion current have been able to resolve individual nucleotides and a single base trapped at a double-single strand junction in a hairpin but have not been able to read along a DNA molecule continuously. Very recently, we have shown that it is possible to identify individual bases and read along a DNA molecule using a technique we call Recognition Tunneling. Recognition molecules, covalently bound to electrodes, are used to transiently trap each base in turn through noncovalent bonds, giving distinct electronic signatures of all four bases and 5-methyl C. The trapping time with no external force applied to the DNA is long (seconds). However, unbinding is readily accelerated to very short times by the application of small forces, so Recognition Tunneling also provides a straightforward approach to translocation control. Here, we propose to combine Recognition Tunneling with nanopore translocation using metal or graphene nanopores, and metal or carbon nanotube reading electrodes, the probes and pores both being functionalized with recognition molecules. We will study translocation-control in functionalized, conducting nanopores, using both the bias across the pore and the surface potential of the conducting pore as control signals. Using a scanning-tunneling microscope (STM) platform, we will make measurements of Recognition Tunneling signals as DNA emerges from the nanopore. Multiscale (quantum to fluid-mechanical) simulations at Oak Ridge National Laboratory will help us to understand and optimize the translocation and readout processes. This understanding will be shared with collaborators who are developing nanopores with fixed (as opposed to STM) reading schemes with the ultimate goal of producing sequencing chips that are cheap and contain many thousands of devices.Recognition Tunneling is a new analytical tool that generates a distinct electronic signal for each of the four bases in DNA, as well as identifying a modification that underlies the epigenetic code.

The proposal addresses Common Fund priorities by extending the range of signatures available to the LINCS centers. A sandwich microarray, called the ""Cellarium"" will be developed and used to analyze individual live cells. The bottom layer of the sandwich supports cells in shallow microwells etched in glass. The top layer of the sandwich seals the cells in the 150-picoliter microwells, and incorporates extracellular fluorescent sensors for multiparameter detection of the metabolic analytes, oxygen, pH and glucose. Chemical isolation is achieved when the two layers are compressed together with a flat metal spring allowing dynamic measurement of transmembrane fluxes without Intracellular probes. Single-cell analysis which directly reveals heterogeneity in metabolic response to perturbations within an isogenic cell population is critical to biological inference. This microarray is an extensible tool for deriving a standardized multiparameter set of data that can be integrated in a coordinated way into LINCS.

"668","CEGS: Microscale Life Sciences Center",NULL,"Increasingly, it is becoming apparent that understanding, predicting, and diagnosing disease states is confounded by the inherent heterogeneity of in situ cell populations. This variation in cell fate can be dramatic, for instance, one cell living while an adjacent cell dies. Thus, in order to understand fundamental pathways involved in disease states, it is necessary to link preexisting cell state to cell fate in the disease process at the individual cell level. The Microscale Life Sciences Center (MLSC) at the University of Washington is focused on solving this problem, by developing cutting-edge microscale technology for high throughput genomic-level and multi-parameter single-cell analysis, and applying that technology to fundamental problems of biology and health. Our vision is to address pathways to disease states directly at the individual cell level, at increasing levels of complexity that progressively move to an in vivo understanding of disease. We propose to apply MLSC technological innovations to questions that focus on the balance between cell proliferation and cell death. The top three killers in the US, cancer, heart disease and stroke, all involve an imbalance in this cellular decision-making process. Because of intrinsic cellular heterogeneity in the live/die decision, this fundamental cellular biology problem is an example of one for which analysis of individual cells is essential for developing the link between genomics, cell function, and disease. The specific systems to be studied are proinflammatory cell death (pyroptosis) in a mouse macrophage model, and neoplastic progression in the Barrett's Esophagus (BE) precancerous model. In each case, diagnostic signatures for specific cell states will be determined by measuring both physiological (cell cycle, ploidy, respiration rate, membrane potential) and genomic (gene expression profiles by single-cell proteomics, qRT-PCR and transcriptomics; LOH by LATE-PCR) parameters. These will then be correlated with cell fate via the same sets of measurements after a challenge is administered, for instance, a cell death stimulus for pyroptosis or a predisposing risk factor challenge (acid reflux) for BE. Ultimately, time series will be taken to map out the pathways that underlie the live/die decision. Finally, this information will be used as a platform to define cell-cell interactions at the single-cell level, to move information on disease pathways towards greater in vivo relevance. New technology will be developed and integrated into the existing MLSC Living Cell Analysis cassette system to support these ambitious biological goals including 1) automated systems for cell placement, off-chip device interconnects, and high throughput data analysis with user friendly interfaces; 2) new optical and electronic sensors based on a new detection platform, new dyes and nanowires; and 3) new micromodules for single-cell qRT-PCR, LATE-PCR for LOH including single-cell pyrosequencing, on-chip single-cell proteomics, and single-cell transcriptomics using barcoded nanobeads.","Increasingly, it is becoming apparent that understanding, predicting, and diagnosing disease states is confounded by the inherent heterogeneity of in situ cell populations.

"669","Modeling Anthropogenic Effects in the Spread of Infectious Diseases",NULL,"Globalization has increased the likelihood that susceptible and infected individuals of many species will be brought into contact, so increasing the disease risks for humans and animals alike. For human diseases, contact depends on choices that people make that bring susceptible and infected individuals together. For domesticated and wild animals, contact depends on the transactions people make that bring susceptible animals into contact with infectious agents. The spread of emerging infectious zoonotic diseases, depends on both things. While epidemiologists recognize the importance of human behavior in the spread of diseases they do not model the decision processes involved. Embedding these decision processes in the contact function in compartmental epidemiological models is expected to enhance their capacity to predict the introduction and spread of infectious diseases, and to provide an opportunity to evaluate incentive based disease management policies (Fenichel et al, 2011). The research will incorporate the economic drivers of 'contact' into dynamic models of emerging human and animal infectious disease systems, and analyze the system dynamics with and without adaptive responses. The models will be calibrated for a set of diseases where people's trade and travel decisions are potentially important (initially H1N1, H5N1,FMD). The aim is to strengthen the power of compartmental epidemiological models (a) to predict the likelihood that diseases of particular types will be introduced and the course of diseases once introduced, and (b) to evaluate the potential for incentive-based policy responses to disease threats and disease outbreaks. The research team has been built over a number of years through collaboration in three networks: an RCN - BESTNet; the international biodiversity science program DIVERSITAS; and a NIMBIOS working group - SPIDER.

"671","Detection of Engineering Nanomaterials in Drinking Water, Food, Commercial Product",NULL,"Nanotechnology is rapidly resulting in the production of nanomaterials (NMs) that will be used in everything from toothpaste to pesticides, yet the research community lacks adequate techniques to measure the size and concentration of nanomaterials in even the simplest of environmental and biological samples at levels which may be relevant to human exposures. The National Nanotechnology Initiative, including NIEHS, and other organizations ranks as a top priority the need to develop methods to quantify nanomaterials in matrices including drinking water, commercial products, blood and other biological matrices. The purpose of our proposed work is two-fold: first, we aim to develop state-of-the- art exposure assessment tools for nanomaterials for the international scientific, medical and regulatory community; second, we will identify and quantify the metrology gap between what exposure levels may be potentially harmful based on published toxicological data and the method detection limits that can be achieved for non-labeled commercial nanomaterials with current technology. Inorganic and carbonaceous nanomaterials are being synthesized in a wide range of sizes, shapes and with various surface coatings or functionalities. Consequently, people may soon be exposed to thousands of different types of nanomaterials in their workplace or during other daily activities. Risk assessments from these exposures are hampered by the lack of adequate detection capabilities. While electron microscopy and other techniques can image NMs in samples, they fall short of being able to quantify the size, number concentration and mass concentration of NMs which are thought to be crucial for understanding to properly assess NM exposures and effects. We hypothesize that two basic instrumentation platforms (ion coupled plasma mass spectroscopy and liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy) can be developed in conjunction with sample pretreatment methods, involving extraction, separation and or concentration of NMs from environmental and biological samples, to quantify the size, number concentration and mass concentration of the currently most widely used inorganic NMs (Ag, TiO2, Au) and carbonaceous NMs (fullerenes and functionalized fullerenes). To support this hypothesis we will exploit techniques initially developed to quantify natural aquatic colloids (i.e., NMs) and organic pollutants. Specifically, real time single particle ICP mass spectroscopy (RTSP-MS) will be used to differentiate metal or metal oxide NMs from dissolved ionic forms of the base NM material. Carbonaceous NMs will be handled in a similar fashion as organic chemicals, by pre-treating and analyzing (LC/MS) them based upon solubility and hydrophobicity characteristics. By working with a range of widely employed NMs the methods will be immediately and widely applicable. Standard operating procedures for NM analytical techniques and extraction protocols will be developed. The investigators have been working with NMs for many years, and are familiar with purchasing, characterizing, solubilizing and handling NMs. Using robust statistical approaches, the procedures (detection limits, precision, accuracy, reproducibility, recovery rate, etc) will be validated. Once validated, the pretreatment methods and analytical techniques will be used to quantify engineered nanomaterials in drinking water, food, consumer products and biological fluids (including whole blood, blood plasma, blood serum, urine and human milk). Our team has extensive experience in the analysis of manmade pollutants in these matrices. Due to a presumably low present ambient exposure to engineered NMs, except perhaps for TiO2, we do not expect to detect these types of materials in our archived samples of biological fluids or drinking waters. After testing this hypothesis, we will fortify aliquots of pools of blood, human milk and urine, respectively, with known and increasing concentrations of diverse engineered NMs, until detection becomes possible. In addition to validating the procedures, this work will establish the present body burden in humans of NMs (or lack thereof) and will help to define what levels of these materials are required in order to achieve detection of engineered NMs with state of the art techniques. All protocols developed will be published in peer- reviewed journals and made freely available on the Internet as step-by-step procedures to enable other laboratories and researchers in the U.S. and abroad to utilize these new human exposure assessment tools. In our data analysis and interpretation, we will compare achievable method detection limits with toxic threshold information to evaluate the prospects of using these novel tools for environmental exposure assessment and for protecting human health. This project will provide to the emerging nano environmental and health effects community well documented analytical techniques and methodologies for quantifying the size, number concentration and mass concentration of engineered nanomaterials within matrices (water, food, biological fluids).

The Quantum Energy and Sustainable Solar Technologies (QESST) Engineering Research Center will transform the existing electricity generation system towards a sustainable and ubiquitous one by developing photovoltaic (PV) technologies with higher efficiency and novel functionality. QESST will meet the TW challenge by enabling a large, sustained growth rate of photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation by circumventing the trade-off between efficiency increases and cost decreases, allowing PV devices that are scalable to commercial production and which provide a route for continuous improvements in performance and affordability. The first thrust supporting this goal directly addresses the energy generation system itself through development of technologies and policies which will allow the scale-up of novel PV devices into large-scale manufacturing, enabling the PV industry to rapidly reach TW levels of energy production.

"674","When Strengths Can Become Weaknesses: Emerging Vulnerabilities in Coupled Natural Human Systems under Globalization and Climate Change",NULL,"<p>Long-lived coupled natural human systems (CNHs) are often distinguished by how they have evolved the right fit between their biophysical and social sub-systems. Researchers have characterized this fit in terms of the close feedbacks that enable a system to function well when faced with a known set of disturbance regimes. This project addresses a key question that naturally arises when these systems are exposed to a new set of disturbance regimes or novel change as is likely to occur with increased globalization and climate change: to what extent do the interdependencies that developed to strengthen the system's capacity to fit to a certain set of disturbances limit or enhance its capacity to refit to new conditions? To address this question, the project team will focus on a particular class of CNHs - small scale irrigation systems where the built infrastructure plays a critical role in resource provision. A multi-method approach will be employed that begins with the qualitative analysis of a large number of case studies to develop a typology of irrigation systems. A subset of previously examined exemplar cases will be revisited to examine how they have coped with new vulnerabilities that have emerged. In parallel, field experiments will be conducted with resource users and infrastructure providers that apply principles of behavioral economics to social dilemmas that emerge in irrigation systems in order to test the robustness of collective action to different stressors. These will be followed by laboratory experiments with college students to examine whether the findings can be generalized to other systems. Finally, insights from the case studies and experiments will be used to develop formal dynamic models of prototypical irrigation-based CNHs. Using tools from dynamical systems and robust control complemented by numerical experiments and simulation (including agent-based approaches), the qualitative dynamics and associated robustness-vulnerability characteristics of these systems will be studied in order to distill a set of institutional design principles for use in the development of tools for anticipatory governance.</p>

<p>In addition to the study of coupled natural human systems (CNHs) in its own right, this project is motivated by an important practical consideration. The pace at which social and natural systems are currently changing - driven to a large degree by globalization and climate change - has challenged the capacity of several CNHs to self-organize and respond effectively to this change. Ongoing field studies have shown that small scale farms (less than 2 hectares), which constitute 90% of farms worldwide and consume an estimated 70% of developed water supplies, are the most vulnerable to such changes. Since these farms also produce 40% of agricultural output globally and support the majority of world?s poorest people, it is essential to enhance their adaptive capacity in order to maintain food security and alleviate poverty. Focusing on the in-depth study of small-scale irrigation systems, this project pushes ideas of resource governance beyond traditional approaches. Rather than seeking the ""best"" policies for a specific system under a given set of shocks, it seeks to understand how CNHs cope with change under a wide range of disturbance regimes. The theoretical foundation for the project is based on a key insight from engineering: feedback (of which management and governance in CNHs are examples) can be used to stabilize a system and reduce its sensitivity to a given set of disturbances. However, this stabilizing feedback can increase sensitivity to new types of disturbances. By studying responses to a suite of disturbances, this project helps advance a more nuanced understanding of evolution of CNHs in terms of recognizing how in becoming finely-tuned to certain disturbances, systems become increasingly vulnerable to others. Building on this insight through theoretical modelling as well as case studies and field experiments from a wide variety of settings in the southwestern US, India, Nepal and Thailand, this project will develop a set of tools that will contribute to the capacity of policy makers to better anticipate emerging vulnerabilities and design learning and adaptive mechanisms to cope more effectively with change. </p>","Long-lived coupled natural human systems (CNHs) are often distinguished by how they have evolved the right fit between their biophysical and social sub-systems.

"680","Planning Archaeological Infrastructure for Integrative Science",NULL,"<p>A fundamental challenge of science is to understand the processes that shape how human societies interact with one another and that explain how societies are, at once, constrained by and change the natural environments in which they are situated. Because of the complexity of the interactions, achieving these understandings must be seen as a shared enterprise that broadly engages social, behavioral, and economic sciences, as well as a range of natural sciences. Some of these processes are strongly influenced by events that can be readily observed over periods of days, months, or years. Other important processes operate slowly - over centuries or millennia - and their effects often cannot be detected in present-day or historical observations. Because archaeology is frequently the only source of long-term scientific data on human societies and their environments, it is essential that we take advantage of the unique information that archaeology can provide. Indeed, reconstructed archaeological sequences can be seen as completed ""experiments"" in the long-term operation of social and environmental processes played out in diverse social and natural environments. </p>

<p>Systematic archaeological research has been conducted for more than a century. In the US alone, thousands of archaeological field projects are now conducted each year. These projects record large amounts of archaeological and environmental data and produce lengthy reports, in addition to published articles and books. However, overwhelmingly, this information is not readily accessible to scholars. Even if it were accessible, the complexity of the data - due in large part to the enormous diversity of the human behavior it documents - make it extremely difficult to use in the context of synthetic research on social and environmental dynamics. To move forward on this important research agenda, the availability of archaeological data must be enormously expanded and computational methods developed and implemented that make it possible for synthetic research to effectively exploit this huge reservoir of data and documents.</p>

"681","Landscape Sensitivity to Changing Climate: Plio-Pleistocene Erosion and Sedimentation in SE Arizona",NULL,"<p>Remnants of sedimentary basin levels in southeastern Arizona are prominent and striking deposits, and as such they have attracted the attention of geologists from the early 20th century through the present. Despite extensive descriptive work capturing their visual conspicuousness, there is little consensus on the ages or geologic origins of these deposits. Although the sediments with which these landforms were built have obvious source areas that can be traced and mapped, the potential combinations of tectonic and climatic forces conspiring to leave such deposits abandoned are far from clear and have not been well examined. The ages inferred for loosely correlative basin high stands have ranged from ~20,000 years ago to 1.0-2.2 Ma and are based more on conjecture than quantitative geochronology. This project will establish an absolute timeline for the final stages of when these basin were filled with sediments, as well as when the basins were subsequently incised and dissected by regional erosional events. Establishing such a timeline requires application and development of cosmogenic nuclide methodology that will extend its temporal reach and test the innovative use of multiple stable and radio-nuclides. The sampling strategy will cover a broad range of sedimentary basin levels across southeast Arizona and will quantify both the ages of the deposits and the source area erosion rates. Because the undeformed basin high stand surfaces and underlying basin fill may date to the time that active tectonic forcing ceased in the region, the erosion of the surfaces is likely to have been driven by climatic forcing. Firmly establishing the chronology of these features, as well as the paleo-erosion rates of the source areas thus helps to build a bridge in understanding between how tectonic and climatic forces shape the Earth's surface.</p>

<p>The visually arresting nature of these surfaces across southeastern Arizona insures broad interest in their origins as well as how they may enable insight into tectonic and climatic forces. By establishing the geochronology of such widely studied and virtually undated landscapes we will expand the intellectual reach of this project well beyond the testing of hypotheses. Specifically, the Sky Island Alliance will help us coordinate how understanding the impacts of past climates on the landscape will help better predict future changes across the ecologically sensitive areas of this study. Each of the sedimentary deposits that we are studying originates in source area that is now home to endemic species and spatially isolated ecosystems.

"683","Photocatalytic Reduction of Nitrate in Water",NULL,"<p>Nitrate (NO3-) is one the most prevalent ground-water contaminants in North America and world-wide. It poses a risk to human health and has a large impact on the natural nitrogen cycle. Nitrate is regulated by the USEPA in drinking water because it is a known cause of methemoglobinemia, or ""blue baby"" syndrome, and could possibly be a carcinogen or endocrine disruptor. Nitrate is a soluble ion that is difficult to remove by traditional coagulation or adsorption processes. Risks from oxidized pollutants are best mitigated through chemical or biological reduction to innocuous forms (e.g., N2 from NO3-). Photocatalytic reduction has been reported for decades, yet has not been investigated from an engineering approach for nitrate reduction. Research initiated by the discovery of Honda-Fujishima effect for photocatalytic water splitting (e.g., production of hydrogen as a renewable fuel) and subsequent advances in metal loading of semiconductors suggest that nitrate reduction in near neutral pH without addition of sacrificial agents is possible. Furthermore, it now appears possible that photocatalytic NO3- reduction in water could yield innocuous by-products (N2) instead of undesirable by-products that require additional treatment (e.g., ammonia). Photolysis for disinfection is commonplace in the drinking water industry over the past decade and use of light-based technologies for water treatment will continue to evolve because of their effectiveness, small size footprint, ability to operate without wastestreams, etc. </p>

<p>Translational research from the fields of chemistry, material science and physics, where reductive photocatalysts are developed for splitting water, is proposed to be applied towards engineered technologies for nitrate removal from water. The PI's preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility to photocatalytically reduce nitrate and yield gaseous-N by-products. The goal of this project is to explore and optimize the use of photocatalysts as a reductive technology for treating nitrate in drinking water applications. The underlying hypothesis is nitrate can be converted to innocuous aqueous species in drinking water applications using metal-loaded photocatalysts. The primary research objectives will be to: (1) Understand factors and mechanisms affecting NO3- reduction to N2 for different types of photocatalysts; (2) Apply photocatalyst for NO3- reduction in ion exchange brines and local groundwaters; (3) Investigate practical aspects of photoreactor operation (slurry and fixed film photocatalyst reactors) including role of catalyst ""aging"" on catalyst performance in reducing NO3- and catalyst recovery; (4) Screen novel photocatalysts for nitrate and other oxo-anion reduction and develop a framework for selecting emerging photocatalysts for reduction of oxidized pollutants. The preferred outcome is to achieve nitrate treatment under ambient conditions (e.g., pH) and without the need of adding an organic hole scavenger.</p>

<p>The project focuses on nitrate, the most prevalent groundwater contaminant in the USA and throughout many other parts the world. Managing the nitrogen cycle is one of the National Academy of Engineering Grand Challenges. Nitrate limits the use of the groundwater for potable purposes, and is a major cause of eutrophication in surface waters. The project will provide societal benefits as well as benefits to individual students. The primary intent is to disseminate knowledge and credible data on issues related to nitrate in drinking water and potential strategies to treat the water. Towards this end the team plans to organize sessions at conferences and develop an open-access website related to nitrate occurrence, health risks and treatment. The research will educate PhD students in environmental engineering and serve as a thesis topic for MS students at a non PhD-degree granting institution.

"685","Long-Term Dynamics and Resilience of Terrestrial Plant and Animal Communities in the Bahamas",NULL,"<p>Extremely well-preserved plant and animal fossils from flooded limestone caves or ""blue holes"" in the Bahamas provide unparalleled evidence of environmental change over the past five or more millennia. A diverse assemblage of fossil plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates recovered recently from blue holes on the island of Abaco reveals a unique prehistoric terrestrial ecosystem with tortoises as the top herbivores and crocodiles as the dominant predators (rather than mammals, as on continents). This research project will examine long-term ecological change on the islands of Abaco and Eleuthera in order to assess how prehistoric and contemporary plant and animal communities responded to long-term environmental fluctuations, including cultural impacts following the arrival of humans about 1,000 years ago. This project is motivated by two broad, related sets of research questions. First, what were the relative influences of climatic changes vs. human influences in this well-controlled island research setting, and how does this study offer methodological and interpretive insights for distinguishing between these causes in ecological studies elsewhere? Coordinated, multidisciplinary reconstructions of long-term environmental change will consider whether terrestrial ecosystems in the northern Bahamas were resilient in the face of climatic fluctuations but experienced profound impacts with cascading effects following the prehistoric arrival of humans. Dated records of charcoal, pollen, spores, plant macrofossils, and animal fossils will indicate rates of biotic change both before and after human arrival. The second motivating question is: What are the impacts of modern land use on terrestrial biotic communities? The composition and distribution of existing plant and animal communities will be assessed, because they reflect altered resilience as a legacy of both prehistoric and historic land use. The interpretation of long-term trajectories of ecological change on Abaco and Eleuthera will facilitate the differentiation of the biotic effects of climate change vs. the combination of climate change and human impacts in the Bahamas, with larger implications for separating these causes elsewhere around the globe.</p>

<p>This project will provide a basis for predicting the responses of Bahamian and other island ecosystems to climatic and human-related perturbations.

Located on the western coast of McMurdo Sound it forms the largest relatively ice-free area on the continent yet is still subject to extreme environmental conditions: perennially ice-covered lakes, ephemeral streams, extensive areas of exposed soil, limited precipitation, and salt accumulation. All ecosystems are in some way shaped by climate and material transport yet nowhere is this more apparent than at MCM, where life approaches its environmental limits and subtle changes in climate have a major influence on the generation of liquid water. This in turn produces a cascade of processes influencing biological reproduction, productivity, biodiversity, and biogeochemistry. Research has shown that the Dry Valleys ecosystems are very sensitive to small variations in solar radiation and temperature so, while Antarctic ice sheets respond to climate change on the order of thousands of years, the glaciers, streams, and ice-covered lakes here respond almost immediately.</p>

"687","Understanding Supramolecular Architectures in Photosynthesis by Space and Time Resolved Spectroscopy",NULL,"<p>Seventy percent of mankind's current energy needs are met by burning fossil fuels. This is already problematic since oil and gas supplies are limited and because of the adverse environmental effects of rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Moreover this situation is set to get worse as current predictions estimate that our energy needs will double by 2050. Mankind is therefore facing a major challenge to find new sources of clean renewable fuels. Photosynthesis is a biological process able to use solar energy to produce such fuels. The essence of photosynthesis can be described in terms of the following three partial reactions: light harvesting, charge separation, and electron transfer to take electrons from water in order to reduce carbon dioxide to carbohydrate (a fuel). Since solar energy at the earth's surface is rather diffuse, any artificial system designed to convert it into a fuel will need to incorporate a light-harvesting or light-concentration step. The first question any engineer would ask is: what is the design tolerance of such a system? How much architectural flexibility is possible while still retaining both high efficiency light-harvesting and energy delivery to the sink', where that energy can be productively utilized? The project addresses this problem by interrogating natural light-harvesting systems with sophisticated spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, which can tell us how their supra-molecular, meso-scale architecture relates to their overall light-harvesting efficiency. We use as model complexes purple bacteria, which are very simple photosynthetic organisms, for which the structure and function of individual native light-harvesting complexes have been identified. We will first investigate native membranes of purple bacteria by the combined use of time- and space-resolved spectroscopies, in order to correlate their local organization with their light-harvesting function. We will then use this information to begin to construct arrays of artificial light-harvesting complexes, based on synthetic analogues of natural pigments, on surfaces where we can control supra-molecular architecture. Such arrays can, in the long term, be used in devices for producing solar fuels.</p>","Seventy percent of mankind's current energy needs are met by burning fossil fuels. This is already problematic since oil and gas supplies are limited and because of the adverse environmental effects of rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Moreover this situation is set to get worse as current predictions estimate that our energy needs will double by 2050. Mankind is therefore facing a major challenge to find new sources of clean renewable fuels. Photosynthesis is a biological process able to use solar energy to produce such fuels."

The new research collaboration will be initiated through three activities that will take place in the period of one year, hosted by UNAM: 1) a plenary planning session of 30 scientists from both institutions, resulting in the development of a conceptual framework that will serve as the common basis for the research proposals that will emerge from this collaboration; 2) consultation with key policy actors and decision-makers in Mexico to define the focal problem domains of the collaborative research, and 3) two small-group research proposal preparation sessions. The primary output of these activities will be one or more proposals for submission to NSF, and potentially additional regional funding agencies. Our interdisciplinary research collaboration will focus on two social-ecological systems in Mexico (Mexico City and

"689","Risk Perception, Institutions, and Water Conservation: Enhancing Agricultural Adaption to Future Water Scarcity in Central Arizona",NULL,"<p>In face of increasing drought risk in semi-arid and rapid urbanizing regions such as the US Southwest, it is increasingly important that the diversity of water users collaborate and participate in the adaptation and transformation of water-use systems. Despite declining area in crop production in central Arizona, irrigated agriculture remains the primary water user. While the last decades have witnessed a growth in climate services and drought monitoring in Arizona, as well as programs to support enhanced water conservation in farming, available evidence suggests the Arizona farm sector has yet to take full advantage of these services. We hypothesize that water regulation in the state has buffer farmers from inter-annual variability and climatic shocks, however this increased robustness may be at the expense of the vulnerability of the broader region to future drought and water scarcity.</p>
<p>The objective of this project is to help farmers maximize opportunities to enhance their flexibility in face of climatic stress while also investing in the resilience of the broader social-ecological system on which farmers depend. We address CSI-Water priorities associated with evaluation of institutional readiness and climate risk perception. Specifically, we will evaluate the relationship among farm-level capacities and perceptions, information use, technology adoption and the institutional context of decision-making. We ask: 1) What role do water resource management institutions &ndash; namely, the Ground Water Management Act of 1980 (the GMA) &ndash; play in farmers' perception of climate risk, interest in and use of climate services (specifically drought information and early warning) and capacity to innovate in water conservation? 2) What are the robustness-vulnerability trade-offs associated with different modes of interaction between institutions, information, and agent decision-making in the study area? 3)

"692","In situ Sampling Tool for Assessing Bioavailability and Toxicity of Sediments",NULL,"<p>This project introduces a novel strategy for bioavailability determination of sediment-borne contaminants featuring a wide range of chemical structures, properties and physical-chemical behaviors. The project addresses the pressing need of Superfund stakeholders to determine in a convenient and reliable fashion both human health risks from contaminated sediments and the effectiveness of implemented remediation strategies. The in situ sampling/bioavailability determination (IS2B) tool is a novel, patent-pending device enabling simultaneous determination of contaminant levels in bulk water and pore water at hitherto unattainably low method detection limits (MDLs). When deployed, one half of the tubular IS2B device is buried in sediment and the other is exposed to bulk water. Integrated multi-channel pumps simultaneously draw bulk water and sediment pore water into the active sampling device and push it at, respectively, high and low desirable flow rates through an array of filters and adsorption media. Water samples either can be stored in the device or expelled into the bulk water at will. Due to unlimited access to pore and bulk water during deployment, the IS2B tool provides ultra-low MDLs for a broad spectrum of contaminants, ranging from fully water-soluble to highly sorptive and hydrophobic. This functionality distinguishes the device from presently available passive sampling strategies. Know-how from three previous SRP projects is being leveraged to test the working hypothesis that the IS2B technology can serve to reliably (i) sample bulk and pore water pollutants for analysis in the sub-ng/L range, (ii) inform on the bioavailability and bioactivity of sediment contaminants, (iii) inform on human exposures and associated health risks from fish consumption, and (iv) track the progress of sediment remediation activities. Laboratory and field studies will be conducted with contaminated sediments from Lake Apopka, home to one of Florida's various Superfund sites. To illustrate the breadth of IS2B applicability, this project concentrates on two traditional and three emerging sediment contaminants (p,p'-DDE, dieldrin versus fipronil, triclosan, triclocarban). Because there may be discrepancies between the bioaccumulation predicted via modeling from sampler data and actual bioaccumulation, bioavailability and bioaccumulation of pollutants will be assessed in lab experiments with freshly spiked and long-term aged contaminated sediments via determination of body burdens in two test organisms: Lumbriculus variegatus and Pimephales promelas. Biological responses to contaminant exposure will also be measured in fish using DNA microarray analysis to evaluate effects that may not be predicted solely based on body burden of parent compounds. Mathematical relationships between pollutant concentrations in bulk water, pore water, worms and fish will be formulated from theory and lab data, and applied to IS2B-derived data to predict risk and track the effectiveness of two remediation approaches, granular activated carbon (GAC) amendment and deep tilling of contaminated sediment.","This research project addresses the pressing need for better monitoring of toxicant bioavailability in contaminated sediments by introducing the in situ sampling/bioavailability determination (IS2B) approach.

"693","A Wireless Multi-functional Sensor Badge for Epidemiological Studies",NULL,"Understanding environmental factors in many chronic diseases is a critical and necessary step towards the prevention of these diseases. Reaching the goal requires new tools that can accurately measure various environmental toxicants. Due to large variations in the individuals' genetic susceptibility and environmental exposure, an ideal tool must be wearable so that it can measure the toxicants in real time and within each individual's breathing zone. Several wearable devices have been developed to detect certain chemicals, or particulate matter, and they are expected to contribute to epidemiological studies. However, most epidemiological studies require a capability of assessing multiple analytes in real-time in order to accurately pin down the source of toxicants and efficiently determine if a particular analyte or a group of analytes are responsible for a disease. Pilot studies by others and us revealed that asking a subject, especially a child, to wear multiple different devices for an extended period of time faces several challenges. First, it will take substantial training resources for each child to correctly operate and for each researcher to efficiently maintain multiple devices. Second, the total weight, size and noise of multiple devices will be an unwelcome burden for a child. Third, even though each device could be inexpensive, the total cost of multiple devices can make large-scale population studies cost prohibitive. Finally, different devices have different sampling rates, internal clocks, and data collection frequencies and formats; correct interpretation and synchronization of data from these devices may be prohibitively complicated, especially when deploying them in large cohort settings. In the present project, an integrated multifunctional sensor will be developed using several innovations recently developed in the Pis' labs for real-time measurement of personal exposures. The sensor can simultaneously detect multiple important analytes, including nitric dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, and particulate matter. These analytes are selected because they are important for studying health effects of both outdoor and indoor air pollution. In addition to the capability of detecting multiple analytes, the sensor has an embedded wireless chip that can communicate with cell phones and uses GPS and accelerometer to provide additional location and physical activity information. Finally the sensor will be miniaturized to a wearable badge size. The team will collaborate with industry to ensure quality and low cost production. The sensor development group and the epidemiologists will work together to test and validate the device.","A multifunctional wireless badge-sized sensor will be developed and validated to assess personal exposure levels to multiple analytes.

"701","Water Sustainability under Near-term Climate Change: A Cross-Regional Analysis Incorporating Socio-Ecological Feedbacks and Adaptations",NULL,"<p>Water resource availability varies across the Sunbelt of the United States with a sharp East-West transition at 105 degrees W. Arid regions west of the 105th Meridian produce less runoff compared to humid regions in the East that produce greater than 40 cm of mean annual runoff. Consequently, reservoirs in the West are over-year systems holding multiple years of inflows, whereas reservoirs in the East are within-year storage systems with the need to refill the system in the beginning of spring. Accordingly, water policies also differ substantially with western states pursuing (""prior appropriation"""" and the eastern states following (""riparian rights"") for allocation. These contrasting strategies also impact freshwater biodiversity with the ratio of non-native to native fish species being nearly 6 times higher in the West compared to the East. In spite of these cross-regional differences, both regions face two common stressors: (a) uncertainty in available freshwater arising from global climate change and (b) increased human demand due to population growth and consumption. Consequently, there is an ever-increasing need for an integrated assessment of freshwater sustainability under these two stressors over the planning horizon (10-30 years). The main objective of this study is to understand and quantify the potential impacts of near-term climate change and population growth on freshwater sustainability - defined here as integrating daily to annual flows required to minimize human vulnerability and maximize ecosystem needs (including native biodiversity) for freshwater - by explicitly incorporating the feedbacks from human-environmental systems on water supply and demand in various target basins spanning Arizona to North Carolina. Using retro-analyses involving AR5 multimodel climate change hindcasts, we will revisit how freshwater sustainability could have been better achieved over the past five decades across the Sunbelt. To couple the hydroclimatic and hydro-ecological system dynamics with the management of freshwater infrastructure systems, a two-level agent-based modeling framework will explicitly simulate adaptive behaviors and feedbacks between policy and consumers.</p>

<p>This interdisciplinary project will involve collaboration among three universities, North Carolina State University (NCSU), Arizona State University (ASU), and University of Georgia (UGA). Findings from the AR5 retro-analyses will evaluate and recommend societal options (i.e., supply augmentation vs. demand reduction) for promoting future (2015-2034) freshwater sustainability across the Sunbelt. Cross-regional synthesis of policies and media sources for the targeted basins will identify de-centralized adaptive strategies that have been employed independently and collectively to maintain flows, increase supplies, or reduce demands. Utilizing the near-term hydroclimatic projections, PIs will quantify how current policies on reservoir operations and groundwater extraction could impact the reliability of future water supplies for cities and also alter the key attributes of hydrographs that are critical for maintaining freshwater biodiversity. In doing so, the project will also investigate the degree to which regions have pursued ""hard path"" (i.e., supply augmentation) vs. ""soft path"" (i.e., demand reduction) strategies by explicitly modeling potential societal interventions for freshwater sustainability.

Orchestration is a specific mode of governance which is increasingly used by international organizations to reach their governance goals. Ios act as orchestrators when they try to facilitate or coordinate the governance activities of intermediaries through persuasion and inducement. The UN support for the so-called Kimberly-Process may serve as an example. To make its embargos against so called blood diamonds more effective, the UN helped private businesses and civil-society actors to set up a mechanism to certify diamonds from legal sources and thus to distinguish them from diamonds from illegal sources, especially so-called blood-diamonds. Orchestration is thus defined as an indirect and soft mode of governance which is to be distinguished from traditional governance by regulation which usually directly addresses the targets of governance (the diamonds industry, for instance) with hard instruments of governance (a binding duty to certify, for instance).</p>

<p>While orchestration seems to be emerging as an important governance tool for Ios, it is rarely taken note of in either International Relations or International Law scholarship. It is either ignored altogether or conflated with governance by new modes of governance (which are soft, but direct) or with governance by delegation (which is indirect, but hard). To establish research on IO orchestration alongside existing research on IO soft governance and the growing literature on IO governance through delegation, the project will flesh out the analytical prospects of distinguishing orchestration from these other modes of governance. The aim is to describe different modes of IO orchestration, to identify the conditions under which international organizations use orchestration as a tool of governance, rather than regulation or delegation on the one hand, and to single out the conditions under which Ios use different types of orchestration on the other. To this end, a series of meetings of a small group of European and American International Relations and International Law scholars elaborating the theoretical concept will be initiated and complemented by a series of workshops devoted to assess its empirical merits. The group will publish the results either as an edited volume in a leading University Press or a special issue of a first class International Relations or International Law journal.</p>","The project (Schwerpunkt) aims at analyzing International Organizations (IO) such as the UN in their role as orchestrators.

In this project, the researchers will test the hypothesis that the responsiveness of resource- management institutions to rapid environmental change is ultimately tied to the distribution and types of market-driven, non-family organizations within communities. They will conduct their research in the forested buffer zone of the Chitwan National Park, Nepal, a biodiversity hotspot that is home to the endangered Bengal tiger and more than 200,000 Nepali people who live and farm nearby. One of the world's most invasive plants, <i>Mikania micrantha</i> (""mile-a-minute weed"") recently has spread through community forests and degraded critical ecosystem services that affect wildlife habitat and the livelihoods of residents. To explore the links among non-family organizations, management institutions, and the spread of <i>Mikania</i>, the researchers will collect social and ecological data in 21 heterogeneous community forests to develop models of social-ecological vulnerability and resilience to environmental change. They will conduct two experiments to test the relative strength of factors related to <i>Mikania</i> success, including an educational intervention with management institutions, and a common garden experiment that manipulates environmental variables linked to <i>Mikania</i> growth.</p>

<p>This project will test the ability of the ""family modes of organization"" framework, a powerful explanatory tool in demography, to identify factors that cause coupled natural and human systems to be vulnerable or resilient to rapid change. The project will be an exemplar of ""translational science,"" interdisciplinary research focused on practical solutions to current problems. The investigators will translate research findings into local action through an intervention aimed to slow the catastrophic spread of invasive, exotic species that threatens biodiversity and human well-being. More broadly, the research will aid sustainable development efforts in other settings in south Asia and the Pacific through partnership with a non-profit organization focused on solving issues in agriculture and the environment. The project also will provide education and training opportunities for a new cohort of junior scholars by involving them in interdisciplinary, international research focused on real world problems and their solutions.

Expansion of perennial biomass energy crops such as switchgrass and miscanthus on U.S. degraded and abandoned farmland may prove to be a viable alternative. However, land-use change associated with this expansion may have additional, direct effects on natural water resources that requires assessment prior to large-scale surface alteration to ensure long-term environmental sustainability. This project will integrate physical (i.e., coupled hydro-climatic modeling, using WRF 3.4 coupled to two different land surface models), agricultural (i.e., crop modeling, using EPIC and CENTURY crop models), and socioeconomic (i.e., economic modeling, using FASOMGHG and BEPAM models) elements to evaluate system resilience associated with expansion of perennial bioenergy crops on U.S. degraded and abandoned farmland. Geographically explicit maps depicting sustainable regional ""hot-spots"" of perennial biomass energy expansion will be developed. The research will quantify impacts on the local hydrologic cycle, including effects on soil and groundwater resources (e.g., change in water table depth), and associated climatic consequences to determine if expansion is feasible and sustainable over decadal timescales. Assessment of photosynthetic production of bioenergy crops will be undertaken and resulting modeled yields will be translated to quantify the fraction of U.S. liquid fuel consumption that could be offset. The research will also evaluate economic profitability of growing perennial biomass energy crops in identified ""hot-spot"" areas. Potential designs for extension of agricultural programs, such as the commodity reserve program, to promote growth of perennial biomass energy crops in identified regions, will also be examined.</p>

<p>By exploring bioenergy expansion through an integrated lens that incorporates physical, agricultural, and economic elements, this project will guide local to national level agencies making decisions regarding the feasibility of biomass-derived energy. The modeling tools will enable water and resource managers as well as farmers to recognize impacts and trade-offs of large-scale deployment of perennial biomass energy crops to make more informed decisions for water resource management.

Despite significant advances in geographic information science and technology, however, effectively categorizing digital remote sensing data into detailed urban land categories remains a challenge. This research project aims to develop a frequency-based, multi-scale classification algorithm using overcomplete wavelet transforms that can generate higher-level spatial arrangements of objects and features for detailed urban land categorization. The investigator will seek to enhance spatial modeling and concepts that describe spatial association, spatial pattern, spatial regression, and segregation by adding decomposition procedures that can extract spatial features in different directions at infinite scale. Selected wavelet transforms to be used in the project include a series of Daubechies and Coiflets. The project's multi-faceted approach will permit the new algorithm to be used for any level of scale, from large-scale air photos to coarse-resolution MODIS and AVHRR data. Five distinct normalization procedures will be used to prevent large-range features from dominating the distance measure. The performance of a minimum distance classifier will be evaluated for texture classification using the computed texture feature value of the sub-images. In addition, the Mahalanobis distance rule will be employed to account for the variability of classes. Finally, three classification decision rules will be developed. The project is expected to result in a new wavelet-based framework that provides scientific evidence for the role of spatial properties and frequencies of geo-objects in different directions at infinite scale. This framework and algorithm will be made publicly available for performing image classification effectively in remotely sensed imagery.

This project will enable researchers, modelers, and analysts to differentiate among urban land-cover and land-use types and to categorize detailed urban land data. It is expected to generate maps that are more accurate, thereby improving mapping and analysis procedures. The new geospatial frequency-based framework and methods will help improve semi-automated and automated analysis procedures. The tools from this project will be versatile and can be applied to a wide variety of other land cover, land-use types (i.e., agriculture, rangeland, forest, wetlands, and coastal zones) and conditions (i.e., drought, fire fuel concentrations, desertification, flood risk, and coastal erosion), thereby making it very useful for more than just urban planning.

"708","Evaluation of Drought Risks and Its Impact on Agricultural Land and Water Use to Support Adaptive Decision-Making",NULL,"<p>Irrigation water is a key resource in desert agriculture. Water for agriculture is, however, in direct competition with urban water use and therefore, at serious risk when dealing with long-term and intense drought situations that are expected to increase in many arid regions, including the Southwestern US (National Research Council, 2007). Risk to agriculture varies among regions because of different priorities of use. The overall goals of this study are to better understand how water use by crop type responds to drought conditions and to use this knowledge to support adaptive management in the agricultural sector and foster sustainable water use in an era of climate uncertainty and change. This project seeks to answer the underlying research questions: 1) How does vulnerability to drought vary by crop types based on a large spatial scale analysis?; 2) What is the impact of drought on agricultural water consumption at different spatial scales?; 3) What adaptive options are available through changes in crop mixes and limited time market driven water transfers? and 4) What are the economic cost-benefits of alternative adaptation strategies under different drought scenarios at the farm and watershed levels?</p>
	<p>The project focuses on a highly climate sensitive region within southwestern US which is also subject to strong urbanization pressure: Phoenix Active Management Area (PHX AMA) in central Arizona. Nearly all crops in this region rely on irrigation with agriculture accounting for nearly forty percent of all water used. To address the above research questions, we have set the following objectives: (1) Identify different agricultural crop types in two wet years (i.e., 2001, 2005) and two drought years (i.e., 2000, 2002) over the selected study area using advanced image processing techniques and remotely sensed data (e.g., Landsat, QuickBird); (2) Determine evapotranspiration (ET) or water demand by crop type for the selected years using satellite-based SEBAL/MATIRC; (3) Generate water demand per crop per pixel and integrate with selected drought indicators (e.g., Gridded Standardized Precipitation Index - SPI, gridded Hydroclimatic index); (4) Examine statistical relations between water demand by individual crop types as well as agriculture land as a whole and drought index using spatial regression and analysis of variance tests; and (5) Estimate the economic impacts of drought at both farm and the watershed level and assess economic cost-benefits of alternative adaptation strategies under different drought scenarios using crop budget analysis.</p>

Unfortunately, the way science is taught to non-science students at most large universities tends to reinforce misconceptions. For example, many students satisfy their general science requirement in very large introductory lecture courses based on traditional disciplines. While some of these courses are excellent, they often emphasize facts rather than scientific reasoning. Lectures are often supplemented by laboratories to address this gap. However, when class sizes reach the hundreds, laboratories often feature scripted ""cookbook"" activities that do not teach students to reason scientifically.</p>

<p>In this project, the investigators are deploying and assessing a large-enrollment undergraduate general education science course that places scientific reasoning and multidisciplinary perspectives at the heart of the experience. This model is possible because of developments in online, computer-assisted education (cyberlearning). The project builds on Arizona State University's semester-long ""Habitable Worlds"" course, which is organized around the search for intelligent life beyond Earth. Motivated by the question ""Are we alone?"" students explore key science concepts from astronomy to sustainability using online tutorials that employ interactive simulations and immersive, media-rich ""virtual field trips"" (VFTs). Video lectures are embedded in the tutorials, but as scaffolding rather than as centerpieces. The tutorials utilize an intelligent software platform that responds adaptively to student input&ndash;essentially, a virtual tutor&ndash;and collects data on students' actions and inputs useful for learning research and course development. Such platforms that can be programmed by the instructor are now becoming commercially available. The investigators' thesis is that for large student populations this model is superior to conventional lecture-based online and face-to-face courses.</p>

<p>""Habitable Worlds"" was piloted in Fall 2011 and will have been offered to about 800 ASU students online by the end of Fall 2012. In this project, the investigators, in collaboration with Maricopa Community College District (MCCD) faculty, are deploying and assessing a new version, ""Habitable Worlds 2.0,"" which is optimized to scale to even larger and more diverse student populations.

"716","EAGER: Reduction of Carbon Dioxide to Methane",NULL,"<p>Sustainable generation of fuels through the catalytic conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> is an area of research that has the potential to enhance national energy security while simultaneously providing a mechanism to minimize direct CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Previous studies on CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction to fuels have utilized TiO<sub>2</sub>-based catalysts. A major challenge that exists with utilizing TiO<sub>2</sub> as a photocatalyst for CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction is the fast recombination of electron-hole pairs which are formed by light irradiation. Electrons are needed to generate products via reduction of CO<sub>2</sub>. Efforts to minimize charge recombination are critical for enhancing product formation. Despite past efforts at modifying the TiO<sub>2</sub>-based catalysts using both metal and non-metal modifiers, published data shows relatively low production rates for useful products. Typical products include CO and valuable fuel products such as CH<sub>4</sbu> and CH<sub>3</sub>OH. Several of the catalysts resulted in the formation of multiple products, resulting in the need for gas separation technologies when the catalyst is implemented in a real-world scenario.</p>

<p>Preliminary experiments in the laboratories of Professor Jean Andino at Arizona State University have shown promise for a composite catalyst of RGO-TiO<sub>2</sub>, reduced graphite oxide and titania. The RGO can potentially assist in minimizing charge recombination when TiO<sub>2</sub> is activated by light, thereby making more electrons available for a surface CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction. A potential challenge with using reduced graphite oxide is whether the interlayer spacing would be sufficient to allow TiO<sub>2</sub> to reside between the RGO layers. A modified RGO structure with increased interlayer spacing would alleviate this concern. Moreover, if the modifier for the RGO is capable of selectively attracting CO<sub>2</sub> as compared to hydrocarbons, then this may allow for enhanced functionality. Published data show that CO<sub>2</sub> is strongly attracted to ionic liquids. Andino hypothesizes that an ionic liquid (IL) functionalized RGO-TiO<sub>2</sub> would result in the attraction of CO<sub>2</sub>, sufficient charge separation within the TiO<sub>2</sub> (making electrons available for the CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction reaction), and rejection of the produced hydrocarbons, such as CH<sub>4</sub>, thus reducing separation needs.</p>

<p>Andino has performed preliminary work to synthesize the IL-RGO/TiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst and to test the characteristics of the catalyst for the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to hydrocarbons in the presence of water vapor. The DRIFTS studies showed the IL-RGO/TiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst appears to lead to the selective and fast formation of CH<sub>4</sub> in the absence of any CO. The CH<sub>4</sub> production rate from CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction is more than 30 times higher than that which was published by any other research group. The results (taken in conjunction with literature data) suggest that the newly developed IL-RGO/TiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst produces CH<sub>4</sub> at a rate that is far superior to any other existing catalyst.</p>

<p>This is an ideal basis for this EAGER award. Researchers typically use GC techniques to quantify the data and not the DRIFTS IR spectroscopy technique. Furthermore the impact of oxygen presence on product yield needs to be known. The proposed EAGER award will provide the necessary data to confirm the observation and generate additional data to support a full investigation.</p>

<p>This EAGER is expected to have several broader impacts in the catalysis area and will broaden participation in the field. First, the data that will be generated will help to establish the usefulness of the IL-RGO/TiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst in the direct and selective generation of a valuable fuel (CH<sub>4</sub>). This work could have significant impacts in the areas of national energy security and the control of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The proposed project would be used to partially fund two traditionally underrepresented chemical engineering graduate students. The experience of working on the proposed project that has a strong connection to society's grand challenges has already inspired these students, and is expected to help retain them in science and engineering. The expectation is that both students will make sufficient progress so that at least one peer-reviewed paper will be submitted and presentations made locally and also at annual meetings of either the American Chemical Society, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, or the Air and Waste Management Association in 2013. </p>","Preliminary experiments in the laboratories of Professor Andino have shown promise for a composite catalyst of RGO-TiO<sub>2</sub>, reduced graphite oxide and titania.

Unfortunately, climate change has dire implications for these ectotherms. Lizards prefer a narrow range of body temperatures (TB); this limits their activity in space and time. In summer, a global increase of 1-2 C can theoretically restrict daily lizard activity below the minimum required for survival and reproduction. As a result, climate change is predicted to drive 40% of lizard populations extinct by 2080 (Sinervo et al. 2010). This assertion that large-scale shifts in climate are relevant to small ectotherms which experience temperature on a sub-meter scale assumes that species will not adapt by dispersal or shifting their activity patterns. However, local adaptations may already be observable in Phoenix, AZ, where a heterogeneous urban heat island (UHI) averages +3 C and can locally exceed +10 oC at night (Hawkins et al. 2004, Brazel et al. 2007). Ecological consequences of the UHI remain almost completely uninvestigated, and this knowledge will complement the current research emphasis on the consequences of urbanization for local organisms. Studying real lizards in this complex environment will suggest means by which continued development in Phoenix can be made less detrimental to a variety native species, and inform current proposals to use ecosystem services for UHI mitigation.</p>","<p>I am using the Survey 200 data and North Desert Village experiment site to assess the impact of the urban thermal landscape at multiple scales. At a subset of the survey 200, I will correlated lizard diversity with various landscape metrics and land use and cover types. At north desert village I will assess the changes in potential activity time that various backyards landscaping styles have on lizards, and their opportunities for thermoregulation.</p>

Main Research Questions:

-What is the relative significance of the UHI, and urban land use/cover, for the continued viability of ectothermic communities?

-Can landscaping choices mitigate ecological costs due to warmer climates at small scales?

-What are the environmental ethics of urban parks, and what should their role in sustainable conservation be?",NULL
"719","Ecosystem services from agriculture in a rapidly urbanizing region","<p>The long term research goal of this project is to understand the changing structure and function of the varied forms of agriculture, and the services it provides in the rapidly urbanizing CAP region. The specific ecosystem services of interest here include provisioning (food, fiber and fuel), regulation of water quantity and quality, urban heat island mitigation and recreational and cultural services.  The objectives of the project include: 1) Assessment of current state - Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the nature and extent of urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) in the Phoenix Metropolitan Region through a survey of existing literature, interviews with stakeholders, compilation of census and related data sources, and satellite imagery. 2) Human perception, actions and outcomes - Explore how different stakeholders (farmers, households, water managers and urban planners) perceive and respond to ecosystem services provided by UPA, and how their individual and collective behavior (mediated through institutions)  further change the structure and function of these services. 3) Changing dynamics - Examine how different bio-physical and societal drivers (specifically, the economic downturn since 2007 and the recent agricultural commodities boom) are affecting the dynamics of UPA and its impact on structure and function of ecosystem services in CAP region. 4) Sustainable futures: What are the visions of different stakeholders about the future of UPA in the CAP region.</p>","<p>A major constraint in studying urban agriculture has been the limited information on the extent of urban agriculture, its characteristics, and impacts. So the first part of this project was to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the state of knowledge regarding the nature and extent of UPA through a survey of existing literature, interviews with experts, and compilation of existing data sources (such as the Census of Agriculture and Arizona Department of Water Resources data bases). Satellite imagery of land use by the National Agricultural Statistical Survey (NASS) Cropland Layer data was used to create spatial maps of crop distribution in the CAPLTER region. In order to understand attitudes towards UPA and the local food system, interviews with 30 key stakeholders (including producers, foodservice providers, distributors and consumer representatives) in the Phoenix metropolitan area were conducted in summer 2009. Some new questions have been recently  included in PASS-3 survey to elicit further information on perceptions of  urban residents in CAP region about the local food system and their actions related to self production and purchase of food for own consumption. Subsequent work is focused on examining the impact of: a) the economic downturn since 2007 (which resulted in significant decline in urban property values) and b) the recent changes in price of key agricultural commodities on the dynamics of UPA and its impact on pattern of water used for irrigation in CAP region. The long term research goal here is to understand the feedbacks between urban and agricultural systems and how these adapt to changes in underlying economic and bio-physical conditions. Changes in the current economic environment provides a particularly useful opportunity to understand the role of agriculture in enhancing urban resilience.</p>",NULL
"720","Burrowing owl habitat selection in urban southeast Phoenix, Arizona","<p>Burrowing Owls (<i>Athene cunicularia</i>) are diurnal raptor predators which have experienced population declines due to habitat loss across much of their range in North America. Within the greater Phoenix metropolitan area, Burrowing Owls occur in areas associated with agriculture or open land and canal trail right-of-ways. Unfortunately, when these open spaces become developed, Burrowing Owls may be translocated and not all owl translocations are successful. By describing the landscape and microhabitat features of known owl residents, natural resource managers who relocate Burrowing Owls in the city can seek features similar to habitats utilized by resident urban owls. The goal of this research was to identify (1) Burrowing Owl abundance, detectability, and occupancy rate, (2) habitat characteristics of occupied owl locations, and (3) types of features (e.g., perch types) used by owls in agricultural fields and along canal trails in the southeast valley of Phoenix, Arizona to aid resource managers in selecting appropriate translocation sites.</p>","<p>To determine habitat selection of Burrowing Owls in the southeast valley of Phoenix, Arizona Shaneen conducted visual surveys for owls during summer 2011 and measured microhabitat and landscape characteristics in 23 agricultural fields (fields) and along 15 canal right-of-ways (trails) in the southwest valley of Phoenix. We estimated occupancy rate and detectability using Program MARK. We identified microhabitat selection using chi-square and z-tests and used logistic regression to relate owl occurrence to landscape variables.</p>",NULL
"721","Dynamics of soil food-webs, microbial communities, and arid ecosystem urbanization","<p>Cites transform ecosystems by changing the landscape to mesic and xeric environments, resulting in fundamental changes to soil moisture, temperature regimes, organic matter content, and nitrogen (N) inputs. However, there is little evidence of how these changes affect belowground microorganisms (e.g. bacteria and fungi) and fauna (e.g. consumers of microorganisms and their predators) in urban areas. This study seeks to a) differentiate the different groups of soil microbes and fauna, and to b) elucidate possible energy and nutrient transfers, via feeding interactions, in belowground communities from urban soils in four different sites (mesic, xeric, native, native + N). In the summer of 2011, we collected a series of 60 soil cores, split between the dry and monsoon seasons, in metro Phoenix. Soils were processed for flora and fauna, nutrient dynamic quantification, and microbial community molecular analyses.  Our results indicate that mesic lawns harbor increased soil moisture over two seasons (dry and monsoon) relative to xeric and native desert sites. Furthermore, mesic soils have increased counts of fungivorous and predatory soil microarthropods. Measurements of net N nitrification and mineralization were the highest in mesic lawns, with highly variable rates in xeric sites.  In addition, preliminary data show that archaea, not bacteria, dominate ammonia oxidation in the desert soils sampled here. This research will innovate urban biogeochemistry research by coupling organismal activity at different scales of the soil community with observations of N cycling patterns across a mosaic of human dominated landscapes.</p>","<p>Our site habitats will include a gradient of anthropogenically influenced sites with contrasting nutrient (e.g. N deposition, fertilization) and water inputs to soil.

1) Who are the major groups of soil flora and fauna across an urban habitat gradient? We will address this question by using a unique, multi-disciplinary approach. We will create a DNA “fingerprint” profile of the microbial community (i.e. bacteria, fungi) and also calculate the biomass of each major group (prokaryotes, microarthropods, nematodes, etc.). This will help us understand who is involved with decomposition and nutrient cycling and how the inputs (e.g. water, N, organic matter) of contrasting urban ecosystems lead to a change in belowground food web structure and nutrient cycling dynamics. 

2) What is the role of fungi over a habitat gradient? After experimentally eliminating fungi from soil in each habitat, we will measure the soil food web, microbial genetic composition, and biogeochemical parameters in the soil. This will help us understand the role soil fungi play in structuring belowground food webs and nutrient cycling in an arid, urban environment. 

3) How do nutrient cycles and gas fluxes change over the habitat gradient? This approach gives us the chance to combine our empirical observations of soil flora and fauna along with biogeochemical data (e.g. mineralization rates, soil respiration). Furthermore, we will then couple these data to habitat characteristics to enhance our understanding of how the ecology of urban ecosystems changes with landscape use.

Methods
We collected soils in unfertilized deserts, N fertilized deserts, urban xeriscape sites, and mesic landscaped sites within the city.  Biotic extraction protocols using funnel extraction method and microscopic enumeration were used for microbial biomass, nematode and microarthropod characterization, soil protozoa quantification, and epigeic fauna (with pitfall traps).  Additionally, we measured net N nitrification and mineralization using bulk soil incubations.  These published methods are common and often employed by soil and microbial ecologists to produce large data sets about the characterization, diversity, and abundance within the various trophic groups. We will be able to relate the populations within these communities to each other in response to altered soil conditions. Additionally, we will set-up small experimental plots to delete the fungal production channels in the belowground food by using fungicides on buried litter bags filled with soil. Buried litter bags will allow for controlled application of biocides in the field relative to pouring chemicals into the soil column. We will measure the biotic parameters described previously to address the research question regarding fungal contribution.</p>",NULL
"722","Microbial community structure and nitrogen cycling in arid ecosystem soils","<p>Microorganisms play a key role in cycling nutrients in terrestrial and aquatic habitats.  Nitrification is the conversion of ammonium (NH4+) to the more mobile nitrate (NO3-), which may pollute groundwater or be converted to a greenhouse gas through denitrifying processes.  In contrast, some microbial activity is beneficial for agriculture by transforming nitrogen (N) compounds into usable forms for plants.  Overall, microbes are vital in controlling the availability of N, directly and indirectly affecting ecosystem services.  The scientific community is only beginning to uncover the identity of different types of microbes relevant for N cycling.  However, this knowledge is lacking in both deserts and cities, despite urban growth and the commonness of arid and semi-arid ecosystems in the world.  Additionally, recent evidence suggests that fungi are responsible for nitrification and denitrification in some dryland soils, but the extent of these processes have not been explored.  The aim of this research is to 1) investigate the role of heterotrophic fungi in nitrification and nitrous oxide (N2O) production in a range of soils under and between plants from arid ecosystems in the US Southwest and 2) characterize microbial contribution and describe the temporal dynamics between community composition and N cycling in response to environmental change.</p>","<p>To investigate fungal contribution, soils were collected from urban and Sonoran Desert sites across the Phoenix metropolitan area, and from higher elevation grasslands in Arizona and New Mexico.  N2O production was measured from soils incubated at different moisture contents with and without biocide treatments (fungal and bacterial inhibitors).  Nitrification potentials were measured with and without biocide treatments and acetylene, an inhibitor of autotrophic ammonia oxidation.  Potential nitrification in all soils decreased with additions of acetylene, indicating that autotrophic microbes are responsible for this process rather than heterotrophs (e.g. fungi).  Fungi also played a minor role in N2O production from urban lawn soils that were highly managed with irrigation and fertilizers.  In contrast, fungi played a major role in N2O production from desert and grassland soils under and between plants.  Fungi may be responsible for denitrification in a wide range of aridland soils and this function changes with land-cover modification associated with urbanization, consistent with recent suggestions that fungal growth and survival may be favored in arid and semi-arid ecosystems where high temperatures and low moisture conditions are prevalent. This sub-project has been completed and is currently in preparation for submission to Soil Biology & Biochemistry.</p>    

<p>For the project exploring temporal dynamics of ammonia oxidation, soil archaea and bacteria are known to oxidize ammonia to nitrite, in a key pathway of the N cycle.  Recent research in mesic ecosystems has shown that N enrichment alters ammonia-oxidizing communities and increases ammonia oxidation (AO) rates.  Most of these studies measure the microbial community and AO rates at single time points after experimental N addition, lacking resolution to document the timing of community compositional and functional change.  N inputs from natural (e.g. mineralization) or anthropogenic (e.g. atmospheric deposition) sources may alter ammonia-oxidizing communities, but only after reaching a threshold of N concentration or exposure time.  We ask, what are the temporal dynamics that control ammonia-oxidizing communities and their effects on ecosystem processes?  N fertilization is expected to create a new niche for ammonia-oxidizers.  We used soils from N fertilized (NH4NO3 added at 60kg N/ha/y since 2005) and unfertilized Sonoran Desert soils near Phoenix, Arizona, to measure AO using the nitrite-accumulation method (sodium chlorate inhibition of nitrite-oxidation).  Measurements were taken for 1) potential rates using 6-hr shaken-slurry assays in optimal conditions and 2) actual net rates using 48-hr static incubations simulating natural conditions.  Potential and actual rates were measured under a range of starting ammonium concentrations to develop a response-curve of AO kinetics.  We found that long-term N fertilization increased rates of potential and actual AO across the full range of ammonium concentrations added during the assays, compared to unfertilized soils.  N enrichment may have also selected for ammonia-oxidizing populations that are adapted to lower pH, as pH was negatively correlated with AO rates across all samples.  Additionally, potential and actual AO rates did not correlate with each other, indicating that the two assays used were measuring activities from different groups of arid-adapted ammonia-oxidizers in these soils.  These results suggest that long-term N fertilization alters the ammonia-oxidizers, which may occur through changes in the community composition or through an increase in the absolute number of ammonia-oxidizing cells.  Using clone libraries to characterize the ammonia-oxidizers, preliminary data indicates that that archaea are more abundant but less diverse compared to bacteria in these soils.  In addition to measuring whole-soil AO and molecular techniques to identify and quantify ammonia-oxidizers, we are setting up experiments that are designed to characterize the short-term and long-term shifts in community structure in response to ammonium availability.</p>",NULL
"723","Regional water quality monitoring and evaluation for the metropolitan-Phoenix area water supply","<p>The goal of the project will continue to be providing timely input on taste and odors for process control and canal-management decisions, plus providing critical information on other water quality parameters in the water supply system, conducting applied research, and education/communication.  The project will include three tasks, each financially supported by one or more entities. The proposed activities have been developed based upon our collective experience over the past ten years, discussions with major partners, and perceived opportunities to make large improvements in water quality. </p> 

<p>Massive forest fires in Arizona in 2002 impacted organic matter levels in the Salt River reservoirs for several years.  The recent Wallow Fires may have the same impact.  Research is proposed that includes field sample collection, analysis of organic matter and nutrients in the samples.  This project will involve participation of SRP for sample collection and other local cities for data analysis.  Additionally, we will track the water quality from Saguaro Lake down through the canal system to Phoenix water treatment plants on a monthly basis.</p>","<p>Quarterly samples will be collected from all the Salt River reservoirs (Roosevelt, Apache, Canyon, and Saguaro Lakes).  Additional samples will be obtained monthly from Saguaro Lake, and as available from the USGS for the upper Salt River and White River are inflows to Roosevelt and will be impacted by the Wallow Fires.  Samples will be analyzed for organic matter parameters, nutrients (total and dissolved P and N), conductivity, MIB/Geosmin and other parameters potential influenced by runoff from the fires.  Sufficient data will be collected to be used in a disinfection by-product model to quantify the potential impact of the fires on raw and treated water quality at Phoenix water treatment plants.  A process model will be developed for the series of Salt River reservoirs which at a high level are capable of simulating realistic operation (including hydropower pump back) and chemical reactions capable of estimating the fate of organic matter.  The models will be run under several scenarios to understand the potential influence of the forest fires on water quality in the entire salt river system.</p>

<p>This is a long term project that has been co-sponsored by local cities (Tempe, Phoenix, Peoria, Glendale, Chandler), CAP and SRP, and a private water provider (Arizona American Water) to understand trends in regional water quality.

"724","Landscape configuration effects on the urban heat island in Phoenix, AZ","<p>This study considers how the configuration of land cover affects the urban heat island in Phoenix, Arizona. We consider both the composition of land covers and the configuration, e.g. shape and size of patches, to determine the effects of landscape pattern on the urban heat island. Using methods from landscape ecology, we quantified spatial structure and then assessed the correlation between land surface temperature and spatial configuration of land covers. Based upon high-resolution land cover data, we examine three built land use categories in Phoenix: mesic residential, xeric residential, and industrial/commercial. The results of Pearson’s correlation analysis and multiple linear models reveal that composition and configuration both explain the variance in land surface temperature. Configuration variables were significantly correlated with temperatures in both mesic and industrial/commercial areas. Inclusion of configuration variables improved the fit of linear models compared to models that only included composition variables.</p>","<p>We used a high-resolution land cover map (derived from Quickbird imagery) and ASTER temperature data to evaluate the relationship between landscape structure and land surface temperatures. We randomly selected 90 sample locations in residential and industrial/commercial areas, and then created 240-meter sample plots for each of these locations. Using corresponding subsets of the land cover map, we calculated a series of landscape metrics using the Fragstats software package. Pearson’s correlation analysis provided an assessment of the relationship between land surface temperatures and landscape metrics for each sample site. Finally, we created a several linear models to characterize the relative impact of each variable on land surface temperature. </p>",NULL
"725","Visualizing uncertain science for environmental decision making support","<p>Environmental decision makers increasingly rely on scientific information to inform decisions. Although this integration of science and policy offers the potential to support more informed decisions, scientific results are often not provided in a manner usable to decision makers. When faced with highly uncertain conditions, such as climate change, communicating scientific information in a usable manner becomes even more important. This research presents methods for representing uncertainty for decision support, and seeks to evaluate two questions. First, do implicit representations of uncertainty influence the process of evaluating courses of action and potential outcomes related to water planning? And second, do implicit representations of uncertainty influence how decision makers perceive the relationship of human actions on climate change? Using the existing DCDC WaterSim model, representations of uncertainty that visualize the relationship between projected outcomes of policy decisions and uncertainty (represented as the impact of climate change on water supply) are developed. These visualizations will be evaluated through a human subject test where decision makers interact with uncertainty representations. Participants will be drawn from the water planning community, as well as DCDC and CAPLTER community partners. It is hypothesized that this research will show that individuals use uncertainty representations to identify policy choices that provide the least impact on ground water and will feel more confident than those using representations without uncertainty represented. Moreover, participants who use uncertainty will select policy choices that result in lower groundwater loss, reflecting an increase in their understanding of how policy impacts sustainable water usage.  </p>","<p>I will investigate environmental decision-making under uncertainty by developing an implicit visualization of uncertainty using the existing Decision Center for a Desert City WaterSim model. I will also evaluate how decision makers interact with this representation through human subject testing. This section provides a summary of the case study, the implicit visualization methods, and the human subject evaluation.</p>
  
<p>Water management systems are traditionally operated under the assumption of stationarity—the idea that natural systems fluctuate within an envelope of variability that does not change (Milly et al. 2008). Under the assumption of stationarity, water planners acknowledge the possibility of errors in estimation of water inputs, but assume it is reducible through additional observations, improvements in data collections, or increased data. Climate change, however, poses a challenge to the stationarity assumption; as changes to the Earth’s climate are altering the rate of river discharge, mean precipitation, sea levels, and other aspects of the water cycle and water supply. Water planners express awareness and acceptance of the uncertain nature of the impacts climate change may have on this assumption, as well as the uncertainty inherent in the models used to predict these changes (Howard 2008). Uncertainty visualization offers an opportunity for decision makers to explore how climactic uncertainty (evidenced by changes to the stationarity assumption) affects outcomes of policy decisions, through exploration of the relationship between uncertainty and an outcome space. For the purposes of this study, uncertainty is operationalized as the effect of climate change on the assumption of stationarity, in this case, changes to the historical flows in the Salt/Verde Rivers and the Colorado River. The outcome space represents all potential outcomes for a given set of conditions. For this study, the outcome space consists of the net cumulative change in groundwater (in thousand cubic meters) resulting from running a single set of policy choices in WaterSim. Representation refers to methods to communicate this uncertainty to users (including visualization, graphics, and graphs). Implicit refers to representing uncertainty in relation to the outcome space, to support exploration of how differing decisions and assumptions about stationarity (the uncertainty) have an impact on groundwater (the outcome). Decisions refer to the policy choices users make while working in WaterSim on a presented task.   
	An interactive website and tutorial for the Decision Center for a Desert City’s WaterSim Model currently exists (http://watersim.asu.edu/). This research will adapt the existing model, and build a new site and tutorial for use in this study. Simulation choices focus on policy decisions relating to population growth, agricultural land retirement and residential water use. Two sites will be developed, one with the uncertainty visualization views and one without. All other navigation and design features will be kept the same between the two sites. </p>
<p>This proposed research includes a survey administered to individual participants drawn from DCDC community partners, CAP LTER community partners and researchers, water managers and planners from other areas, and land use planners and developers. The inclusion of participants without water management experience allows evaluation of whether decision frames (prior experience with the problem and the uncertainty) result in differences in how participants use the implicit representation. I will include a minimum of 30 participants in each group, for both the uncertainty visualization and control groups (minimum 120 participants).</p>",NULL
"726","Urban heat island and environmental justice","<p>Using multidisciplinary data and methods from the social, biophysical, and health sciences, this project investigates the vulnerability of different neighborhoods and groups of people to negative health effects of extremely hot weather in metropolitan Phoenix. There are two overarching hypotheses in this project: 1) Urbanization in the region has produced (and continues to reproduce) segregated residential neighborhoods with increasing levels of environmental and social inequalities. 2) This heterogeneity in living conditions has rendered low-income and racial/ethnic minority populations disproportionately vulnerable to heat-related health hazards that are characteristic of the summer climate in Phoenix. This project builds on and expands research that shows substantial spatio-temporal variation in Phoenix’s near-surface urban heat island (UHI).  We correlate variation in physical characteristics of the UHI with socioeconomic and land cover characteristics of neighborhoods in order to determine differences in exposure to high temperatures, sensitivities of residents to heat-related illnesses, and coping capacities of households to deal with hot weather. The health outcomes evaluated in relation to the spatial form, intensity, and dynamics of the UHI are morbidity and mortality from heat-related causes in Maricopa County during the last decade.</p>","<p>The environmental justice and UHI research uses a geographical information system (GIS) to map remotely sensed land cover data, spatio-temporal temperature information (see description for project on Measurement and Analysis of Phoenix’s Urban Heat Island), and population data from the U.S. Census and the Phoenix Area Social Survey.  Mortality and morbidity data were obtained with approvals from the Arizona Department of Health Services and the Maricopa County Public Health Department. Rates of death and hospitalization from heat-related illness in relation to temperature are estimated using time-series regressions, as well as other statistical modeling and data mining techniques.  Qualitative research methods include historical analysis of data from primary sources on the settlement of early Phoenix. This research is a sub-project of the Urban Vulnerability to Climate Change grant (GEO-0816168) from the Dynamics of Coupled Human and Natural Systems program at the National Science Foundation. Taking account of global and regional trends in climate change and urban growth in the Phoenix metropolitan area, Urban Vulnerability to Climate Change addresses the interplay between changing urban climate and the socio-ecological systems that amplify or mitigate heat-related hazards for different socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups.</p>",NULL
"727","Fish communities in canals used for metro-Phoenix water delivery","<p>Urban fish communities are established in a myriad of ways, not least of which is that associated with water delivery to populated areas.  In Arizona, much of our water is delivered by canals.  It is well known that these canals house many species of fish, form the source waters, and from bizarre introductions by the general population.  Given that many, if not most, of the bodies of water within Arizona are highly altered in some way by human activities, understanding the fish communities that persist within these artificial waterways is fundamental to a larger understanding of the region's aquatic ecosystems. As a first look at the canal community, we are using stable isotope analysis for detecting long-term diet signatures.  We seek to determine if the diet is canal-based, meaning the fishes have potentially established residency in the system. We hypothesize that many of the species are resident in the canals, and even reproducing there.  These fishes have their own community that is maintained over long periods of time, ranging from months to even years (depending on the persistence of water).  Therefore, we hope to gain an understanding of how these fishes interact with one another and the unique physical environment created by the canals.   These fishes will continue to be sampled in order to investigate a number of different aspects of this urban community including genetics (to determine relatedness of canal fishes to stocks in natural and semi-natural waterways), metrics of pollution load (as they affect animal reproduction, growth, behavior and morphology), and eventually laboratory studies of live fishes to quantify behavior and functional morphology (to determine exactly how these fishes interact).</p>","<p>During 2010 and 2011 fish samples were collected from Salt River Project canals through planned drain-downs, whereby SRP dams back a portion of the water and drains a section of the canal.  The fishes left behind in the canal were identified and frozen.  For stable isotope analysis, tissues were collected from the white muscle on the dorsal surface following brief defrosting. Tissues were oven-dried, ground finely, and placed in tin capsules for analysis which was performed at the Goldwater Environmental Laboratory.   Stable isotope values suggested that the food chains/webs in the canal are shorter than is typical of other Arizona bodies of water that have been studied.  There was also lower diversity in isotopic signatures among species than reported for those same waterways.  This reduced diversity suggests the diet of canal fishes overall is not very rich, and is not different from species to species.  This holds true when comparing canal data with either highly invaded, disturbed, or restored systems.   While this finding is not surprising, it suggests that canal fishes have a community structure that is, perhaps, overlooked from an ecological perspective.  Continued sampling of the fishes collected during scheduled drain-downs is planned.</p>",NULL
"728","Vegetation dynamics and resilience in CAP LTER 2000-2010","<p>This research project aims to evaluate long-term vegetation response to humans and environmental factors in Phoenix, AZ. Through research in natural systems, we know that vegetation affects ecosystem functioning and the associated amenities, and the same holds true in cities. In desert ecosystems, vegetation patterns and the associated ecosystem functions are driven primarily by precipitation and temperature, but in urban ecosystems, human decisions trump natural processes in determining the distribution of plants. Because of human management in urban vegetation, we think the recent real estate crisis will have had repercussions beyond the economic arena, down to biodiversity and patterns of urban vegetation.</p>  

<p>Our overall goal is to investigate the following line-of-inquiry for the greater Phoenix area using data from Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research (CAP LTER):</p> 

<p>(1) What patterns exist in urban plant diversity and composition? What were the key socioeconomic and biophysical drivers of vegetation spatial patterns in 2010? What role did the recent real estate crisis play in vegetation patterns?</p> 
<p>(2) How have urban vegetation patterns changed through time from 2000 to now? How do these patterns vary among landcover types? Are there changes in dominant species?</p> 
<p>(3) Are urban landscape patterns resilient to fluctuations in water availability under socioeconomic stress? Can we identify threshold behavior in land use and water usage patterns?</p> 
<p>We are approaching these questions of tomorrow’s complex environmental and sustainability issues using CAP LTER Survey 200 data and an interdisciplinary toolkit of geography, mathematical modeling, and ecology. Increasing our knowledge of how vegetation will respond to urbanization is fundamental to demonstrating the value of urban ecosystem services to human well-being. This project will be able to inform efforts to use vegetation to mitigate the urban head island effect, sequester carbon, improve air quality, and decision regarding water availability and quality.</p>","<p>We are improving scientific understanding of the interactions of socioenvironmental influence and vegetation in urban areas by combining existing data with targeted data-collection, and by using analytical methods from a variety of fields. Our primary data source is the Survey 200, which is one of CAP’s foundational datasets which they have been systematically surveying every 5 years since 2000. The Survey 200 dataset consists of 30x30-m sampling plots randomly located throughout the CAP LTER region. The biophysical data we use includes rainfall, soil type and properties, maximum and minimum temperatures, distance to urban core, fragmentation, topography, and percent impervious cover. We also use socioeconomic variables from the U.S. Census and Phoenix Area Social Survey (PASS) data such as foreclosures, property value, household income, landscaping preference, and resident demographics in our analysis of drivers of plant spatial patterns.</p>
	<p>Our analysis of plant species composition, diversity, and drivers includes multivariate classification and ordination methods, as well as variable selection techniques such as classification and regression trees. These analyses among others allow us to develop an understanding of the influence of the housing recession, water availability, and variables important in a desert city. </p>
	<p>When looking at change in CAP LTER vegetation over time, we use measures of change in occurrence, such as trajectory analysis, of individual plant species, diversity metrics, and overall vegetation composition. These models allow us to evaluate the influence of anthropogenic and environmental change on urban plant diversity, and can reveal non-linear responses in the dynamics of plant communities experiencing multiple stressors - a key issue in coupled human-natural systems.</p>
<p>We also use differential equation modeling to develop a range of scenarios for the complex effects of water use in urban areas on landscaping choices. These models capture the interaction of water available and human decisions about different types of landscaping in their yards. We are then able to scale up these interactions to look at landscape patterns and their effects on urban water use under different future scenarios. These models allow us to identify patterns resilient to global change and socioeconomic stressors.</p>",NULL
"729","Maximizing urban park ecosystem services: A framework for planning and design","<p>Though civic spaces, including parks and greens, have proven to be key providers of ecosystem services both inside and beyond urban boundaries, current research and approaches to their planning and design have failed to acknowledge the full spectrum of challenges and opportunities these areas present, particularly their diverse social, environmental, spatial, and temporal characteristics. Yet in practice, static, generic cookie-cutter park models and people- parkland standards rarely result in socially or ecologically functional civic space; rather such models have led to an abundance of degraded, underutilized, inequitable areas that are anything but an amenity. To address these deficiencies and contribute to urban ecological theory and practice in arid regions, this research conceptualizes civic spaces as heterogeneous human-environment systems that support multiple and distinct social and ecological functions and conditions which are themselves heavily impacted by their socio-ecological-spatial context. From this vantage point, this study integrates theory from urban planning, geography, parks research, and ecosystem services perspectives into the development of a framework for urban planning and design aimed at maximizing the multiple ecosystem services of arid land civic spaces across the urban-to-rural gradient.</p>","<p>Advocating a conceptualization of civic spaces as heterogeneous socio-ecological systems that support multiple and distinct functions and conditions which are heavily impacted by their socio-ecological-spatial context, this research seizes the opportunity to contribute to urban ecological theory and practice in arid regions by integrating two powerful and complimentary, but individually incomplete approaches to sustainable urbanism: the SmartCode and Ecosystem Services frameworks. The resultant <i>Arid Lands Civic Space Ecosystem Services (ALCSES) SmartCode</i> module will enhance the benefits, while minimizing the weaknesses, of both approaches.

	<p>Using a review of literature on landscape requirements across the urban to rural gradient for ecosystem services in arid lands, and soliciting feedback from urban ecology researchers, the research will a) identify potential civic space ecosystem services and landscape requirements for arid regions across urban intensities (i.e. urban core to rural landscapes); b) develop an urban-to-rural gradient of ecosystem services (this will include ‘special districts’ which are not based on urban intensity, e.g. mountain parks or university campuses); c) expand the current SmartCode typology of civic spaces based on their potential/preferred ecosystem services, tailoring it specifically for arid landscapes; d) identify the transect zone(s) best suited to each civic space type based on these specifications; and e) develop a SmartCode module for arid region civic space design informed by the previous steps.</p>",NULL
"730","Developing Best Management Practices Plan for Prevention and Treatment of Zooplankton Contamination in Algal Crop Production",NULL,"The project addresses the Program Area Priority: Crop Protection for Sustainable Feedstock Production Systems. Contamination of cultures and grazing of algae by zooplankton (e.g., rotifers, amoebas and protozoa) represents the most challenging issue for sustainable algal mass culture, preventing algae from being a practical source of oil crops for production of bioenergy and bioproducts. To meet this challenge, we will 1) survey zooplankton contamination in commercial algal production systems; 2) determine biotic and abiotic factors affecting the occurrence, population dynamics and impact of grazing zooplankton on algal crop production; 3) develop a rapid, quantitative diagnostic method and early warning system for the detection of grazing zooplankton using a multiphasic approach; 4) evaluate various chemical and physical means to prevent and treat zooplankton; and 5) develop a comprehensive Best Management Practices Plan (BMPP) for prevention and treatment of zooplankton to ensure sustainable production of algal crops. We will conduct laboratory and outdoor experiments with typical production strains (e.g., <i>Nannochloropsis</i> sp., <i>Chlorella</i> sp. <i>Dunaliella</i> sp. And <i>Cyclotella</i> sp.) grown in both open ponds and closed photobioreactors. We will apply expertise in algology, zoology, cell biology, bio-imaging, genomics and bioinformatics, as well as chemical and physical treatment methods to the study. The proposed project will provide a detailed understanding of the factors influencing the occurrence, population dynamics, impact and control of zooplankton on algal mass culture.

"731","Developing a Life Cycle Assessment Model for Evaluating Policy Implications of Biofuels",NULL,"Recent regulations and variable oil prices have resulted in increased production of biofuels from second and third generation feedstocks. For example, in 2007 the US passed the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA). Many of these new policies call for the evaluation of the greenhouse gas emissions reductions of biofuels using life cycle assessment (LCA). LCA is a well-established sustainability tool for measuring the total environmental impacts of a product or process. We propose to build an LCA-based tool that will allow users to experiment with the implications of different US, state, and local biofuel policies that will evaluate different combinations of feedstocks, processing and conversion pathways to determine the effects that different policies will have on biofuel production and environmental impacts. This Proposal seeks to evaluate and develop policy options for achieving sustainable regional biofuels/bioenergy production and commercialization. We will address a diverse range of agricultural, biofuels, or environmental policy options and opportunities (e.g., standards, mandates, subsidies, tax credits, trade, and agricultural assistance programs) that may impact economic, environmental, social and other prospects. We will include review of the compatibility and challenges between Federal and State policies. Lastly we will address the indirect consequences of changes in agricultural markets and production decisions that policies may have.","This project seeks to evaluate and develop policy options for achieving sustainable regional biofuels/bioenergy production and commercialization."
"732","Molecular Sieve Inclusion Nanocomposite (MoSIN) Membranes for Liquid Separations",NULL,"<p>This project is to develop and characterize a new class of chemically resistant Molecular Sieve Inclusion Nanocomposite (MoSIN) membranes for liquid separations. These MoSIN membranes will incorporate selective molecular sieve nanoparticles into barrier-polymeric thin films for osmotic and pervaporation applications. This is a new research direction that leverages the Dr. Lind's extensive experience with synthesis and characterization of zeolite-polyamide nanocomposite reverse osmosis membranes and the extensive research facilities available at Arizona State University. Lind will perform experiments to isolate the intrinsic transport properties of the components of model mixed-matrix membrane systems. She will couple fabrication experiments with rigorous characterization to elucidate the impact of fabrication conditions on MoSIN membranes, material structure, and liquid separation properties. Unlike traditional polymeric liquid filtration membranes, the design does not require the polymer matrix to have liquid permeability; this enables the use of a broader spectrum of polymers. A unique aspect of the membrane design concept is that the molecular sieve nanoparticles will penetrate the thickness of the barrier polymeric film, avoiding problems with polymeric blocking of the molecular sieve pores. This new paradigm in membrane design will enable the MoSIN membranes to be processed as polymers.</p> <p>The MoSIN membrane concept represents a new paradigm in liquid separation technology to develop a robust membrane for liquid separations. This concept is applicable to reverse osmosis, forward osmosis, micro and nanofiltration, pervaporation for biofuel recovery, and should be extendable to gas separations. The overall goal of the educational activities of the project is to integrate the research, focused on sustainable engineering solutions for water and energy production, with education of students at multiple stages in the scientific pipeline from K-12 students to graduate students. To do this,Dr. Lind will develop a new six-week summer teacher-internship program for K-12 teachers. In this program Lind and her students will work with one teacher per year from a local school. Together they will develop new teaching modules relating concepts from the research to the grade-appropriate skills taught in the classroom. They will visit the teacher's science classroom during the academic year to facilitate implementation of the newly developed module. Dr. Lind will also collaborate with the Science is Fun program at Arizona State University to disseminate the water-filtration experiment she has developed to a large, diverse group of middle and high school students throughout the greater Phoenix metropolitan area. </p>","This project is to develop and characterize a new class of chemically resistant Molecular Sieve Inclusion Nanocomposite (MoSIN) membranes for liquid separations."

"734","Plasmonic Mapping of Ion Channel Activities in Single Cells",NULL,"Studying and monitoring ion channel activities of single cells are critical for understanding many cellular processes, and for screening ion-channel targeted drug candidates. The current gold standard for electrophysiological recording of ion channel opening and closing processes is the patch clamp technique developed over the past several decades. Although it has been responsible for many fundamental discoveries, the patch clamp method uses a micropipette pressed tightly onto a cell membrane surface and detects electrical current associated with the ion channel activities, which is difficult to operate, low throughput (one- patch at a time) and often invasive (damage to the cell). The proposed project will develop a novel optical method to measure cellular electrical conductance changes due to the opening and closing of ions channels in the membrane. The method is based on the conversion of an electrical conductance signal into a plasmonic signal that can be imaged optically without using the micropipette. This paradigm shift approach promises non- invasive mapping of ion channel activities on single cells with millisecond temporal and sub-micron spatial resolution. The setup is fully compatible with the conventional optical, fluorescence and surface plasmon resonance imaging techniques, thus allowing for simultaneous application of multiple imaging techniques to the same cell, and providing comprehensive and complementary information on ion channels. Such an imaging technique is expected to lead to new insights into drug-ion channel receptor interactions and a new tool for high throughput ion-channel targeted drug discovery. The specific aims of the project includes: 1) develop the plasmonic technique for mapping of ion channel activities in living cells; 2) establish the value of the plasmonic technique for electrophysiological studies using nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as a model system; 3) demonstrate multifunctional measurements and validate the plasmonic technique with the patch clamp and fluorescence imaging techniques.","Patch clamp technique is a powerful tool for studying ion channels of cells, but it is difficult to operate, low throughput and often invasive.

"736","Dynamic State Transitions in Vehicular Traffic and the Effects of Driver Behavior",NULL,"<p>The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program award is to investigate the effects of driver behaviors, such as car-following and lane-changing, on traffic state transitions (i.e., changes in traffic conditions such as speed). This research focuses on transitions near freeway choke points (i.e., bottlenecks), merges, and ends of queues (where vehicles encounter congestion). Transitions around these regions can lead to disorderly traffic conditions, such as stop-and-go driving, due to sharp changes in speed and frequent lane-changing maneuvers. This research consists of four primary tasks of (i) collecting new individual vehicle data, (ii) analyzing general features (e.g. changes in traffic flow, density, and speed) of traffic transitions, (iii) analyzing driver behaviors and linking them to the general features, and (iv) extending/developing models of driver behaviors capable of reproducing the observed transition phenomena.</p>

<p>If successful, this research will uncover the physical mechanisms of transitions; i.e., how individual driver behaviors (e.g., car-following, lane-changing) govern changes in flow, density, and speed in time and space. Understanding these mechanisms has important implications for mobility and safety. Transitions around freeway bottlenecks can determine bottleneck throughput and hence the delays on freeway networks. Further, vehicles in transition regions are more prone to crashes due to sudden changes in speed and frequent lane-changing maneuvers. Therefore, the results from this research will potentially advance traffic control strategies to manage congestion more effectively and improve safety. Educational and outreach activities involve the development of a project website, a smart-phone application to collect probe data, web-based modules for hands-on learning of data analysis methods and modeling. Using these means, this project will engage undergraduate and graduate students, STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) high school teachers to reach out to high-school students in the long term, researchers in other disciplines, and industry stakeholders.</p>","The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program award is to investigate the effects of driver behaviors, such as car-following and lane-changing, on traffic state transitions (i.e., changes in traffic conditions such as speed).

Phoenix continues to take a leadership role in the world of sustainability and has identified several key subject areas in its sustainability plan, which includes municipal waste. Waste value stream management is one of the most difficult, and potentially rewarding, challenge areas within the City's sustainability strategy.</p>
<p>With a population of 3.8 million people in Maricopa County, the Phoenix metropolitan area disposed of more than five million tons of residential solid waste material at local Phoenix metropolitan area landfill sites in 2011. This figure represents approximately 70 percent of the total solid waste material disposed of at Arizona landfills. In 2011, the City of Phoenix buried approximately 900,000 tons of material in the State Route 85 Landfill; over 600,000 of these tons were generated from the residential solid waste stream.</p>
<p>In a 2003 City of Phoenix waste characterization study, it concluded that more than two?thirds of the single?family waste stream consisted of material that can be recycled or diverted through standard recycling and composting programs. Although the City of Phoenix's commingled recycling program has been in effect for more than 20 years, the average residential diversion rate for the City of Phoenix was 13 percent in FY 2011?12, well below the average national recycling rate of 34.1 percent.</p>
<p>The City of Phoenix has set a goal of achieving a city?wide diversion rate of 40 percent by 2020. To accomplish this, the Public Works Department (PWD) has created a ""Waste Diversion Action Plan"" consisting of a number of programs, strategies, measurable outcomes, and responsibilities.

"739","Sustainability of Marine Renewable Resources in Subarctic Systems Under Incumbent Environmental Variability and Human Exploitation",NULL,"<p>These network activities focus on basic socio-ecological principles applied to the study of the sustainability of renewable resources in large marine ecosystems under incumbent climate variability and human exploitation. Through this network a gap is bridged among ecologists, mathematicians, social scientists and resource managers to provide a sound science support system for conservation. Case studies are selected from subarctic marine systems (Northeast Pacific and Northeast and Northwest Atlantic), which are susceptible to climate variability, are highly productive but also intensely exploited, and are under-represented in socio-ecological literature. The scientific activities are centered on three ecological themes, namely, sequential 1) species, 2) spatial, and 3) demographic depletions. Collectively, these three themes address how current policy decisions may cause negative and unforeseen socio-ecological effects as they reverberate through the system. The research activities are integrated by developing a conceptual socioecological framework to address the implications for sustainability of current and alternative policy practices (Theme 4). By hosting two international workshops and two annual network meetings, the work takes positive steps to integrate across these research themes, and to transfer approach to other aquatic and terrestrial ecological systems. On the educational side (Theme 5), a three-prong approach is established. First, to provide transdisciplinary training opportunities to participating scientists, graduate students and post-docs through research-exchanges at participating institutions. Second, to organize a summer course that intersects the disciplines involved in our network (ecology, social science and sustainability), and where graduate students and post-docs who benefited from the research exchange program will take an active teaching role. The curriculum will include an intensive two-week summer session followed by a project development at the home institution. The project outcomes will be presented to network and invited scientists and managers during network workshops, and authors will be invited to publish their work in a workshop proceeding special volume. Third, during one of the two workshops, the syllabus and teaching material for the summer course will be developed , and critically evaluate the role of science and education in support of a sustainable management of large marine ecosystems. While the proposal is motivated by applied topics, it is led through the study of basic ecological and evolutionary principles. The ultimate intent is to provide a science and educational support system to integrate eco-evolutionary and social science principles in conservation strategies. Existing governmental agencies are not providing this system, yet will require it in the future. In addressing the network objectives, advantage is taken of ecosystems for which there is a large volume of under-utilized data that well exceeds that of other terrestrial and aquatic parallels.

On the short-term, it provides invaluable training and teaching opportunities to students and post-docs through a system of short-stays in national and international partner institutions and attendance at the short summer course. On a longer term, it provides the guidelines for a new curriculum development in coupled human-resource systems and invaluable opportunities for long-lasting and beneficial research connections. Finally, through a system of travel awards for research exchanges and RCN workshop/meeting attendance, enables involvement of a diverse group of participants, including minorities, students at various stages of their career, and scientists from academia, education and management institutions.","These network activities focus on basic socio-ecological principles applied to the study of the sustainability of renewable resources in large marine ecosystems under incumbent climate variability and human exploitation.

Invasive saltcedar (<i>Tamarix</i> spp.) is the third most abundant tree in Southwestern riparian systems (Friedman et al. 2005). Resource managers must often balance the management goals of protecting wildlife species and habitats with control of non-native and invasive plants. This project will determine if the introduction of the biocontrol agent (tamarisk leaf beetle, </i>Diorhabda</i> spp.) as an insect consumer and defoliator of saltcedar influences wildlife populations and communities via alterations to food resources and/or habitat. By taking advantage of an unprecedented natural experiment and two years of pre-biocontrol monitoring, the researchers will track changes in amphibian and reptile (herpetofauna), and avian communities as biocontrol enters a system dominated by a non-native plant species. The investigators predict that the introduction and proliferation of the biocontrol beetle will affect wildlife groups because this insect is known to be eaten by several wildlife species and because it causes defoliation of its host plant, thereby altering the physical habitat. This work expands upon preliminary research by the investigators which focused on relating wildlife populations and communities to habitat structure in a non-native plant ecosystem prior to the establishment of biocontrol. Our results can help to inform decisions made by natural resource managers by providing guidance on how wildlife species respond (either positively or negatively) to management actions such as biocontrol in riparian habitats.","This project will determine if the introduction of the biocontrol agent (tamarisk leaf beetle, </i>Diorhabda</i> spp.) as an insect consumer and defoliator of saltcedar influences wildlife populations and communities via alterations to food resources and/or habitat."
